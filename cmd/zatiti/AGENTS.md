# Implementation assignment: `cmd/zatiti`

Generated specification revision 1; source digest `c79b39e5ca496cd59114fdaa2c9dd3a36d7c9c0d3b4426bc131063f5cef22ca2`. This file is committed implementation context. Do not independently edit it. Everything required from the product specification and adjacent interfaces is embedded below; no RFC copy is required.

## Mission and scope

Assemble controller/CLI/MCP binary and local bootstrap/helper mechanics.

Write scope: **`cmd/zatiti/` only**, excluding this generated AGENTS.md. Go package name: `main`. Ownership kind: entrypoint; integration wave: 3.

Allowed production imports from this repository: `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/contract`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/platform`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/storage`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/identity`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/configuration`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/skills`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/connections`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/policy`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/reviews`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/accounting`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/tasks`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/scheduling`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/messaging`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/execution`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/effects`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/memory`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/artifacts`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/evidence`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/installation`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/registry`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/application`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/controller`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/server`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/client`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/cli`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/mcp`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/adapters/responses`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/adapters/github`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/adapters/httpread`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/adapters/serenity`. Tests may use interfaces/fakes defined locally and, once available, storage-backed temporary fixtures; integration owns cross-package tests. No sibling raw SQL. No root dependency edits except the integration exception stated in its own brief.

## Implementation decisions and acceptance focus

Own main.go and local entrypoint helpers only. Wire concrete modules to registry/app Ports, storage/platform, adapters/controller/server. main delegates run(ctx,args,stdin,stdout,stderr) int for testability. Commands serve and mcp serve are transport mechanics; public operations come only from registry-generated CLI. Explicit config/profile selection outside model-visible operation arguments. serve owns always-on lock/scheduler; mcp serve uses existing controller and scoped client, no database writer. init and mcp serve --bootstrap call shared local initializer under one-time lock, secret helper local IO, return metadata and end bootstrap mode. No automatic launch of arbitrary client/harness. Configure slog redacted stderr/protected files, signals and bounded shutdown. Root dependencies and CI belong integration, not this scope.

Local proving focus: Actual binary init/status/serve/MCP subprocess, signal shutdown, missing controller, one scheduler, stdout cleanliness, credential environment isolation.

## Incoming and outgoing boundaries

Incoming callers: entrypoint/assembly or tests via the explicit Go API.

Outgoing owner calls: none; use only declared Go dependency interfaces. Each exact input/output schema appears below. Calls retain current Unit/authority; owner allowlists are mandatory.

### Imported package APIs and behavior

These briefs are embedded so you need not read a sibling prompt to discover its incoming API. Implement only your own package.

**`internal/platform`** — Own OS locks, protected local configuration, secret custody, encrypted blob files and client secure storage.

Expose Config{StateDir string; CredentialBackend string; MasterKeyRef string; MaxArtifactBytes int64}; Open(Config) (*Platform,error); (*Platform).Acquire(context.Context) (contract.Ownership,error); Secrets() contract.SecretStore; Blobs() contract.BlobStore; Close() error. SecretStore and BlobStore implementations are separate objects; use OS keychain/Secret Service or explicitly provisioned headless key source. State root 0700, sensitive files 0600, private Unix socket 0600, forbid unsafe symlink traversal and network-filesystem claims. A held exclusive OS file lock spans controller lifetime; close/release is explicit. No plaintext fallback if secure store unavailable. Encrypt sensitive blob bytes using authenticated encryption with per-object nonce and authenticated digest/metadata; master key lives outside SQLite/backups. Stage returns opaque staging identity, digest of plaintext exact bytes, and bounded size. Publish is atomic and durable before metadata reference; repeated identical publication is idempotent. Open decrypts/verifies full integrity before returning bounded requested bytes; missing/corrupt bytes fail artifact_fault. Never return local absolute paths through product interfaces. Disk pressure rejects new artifact-producing admissions and preserves referenced/unknown-obligation data. Export secret helper support through local trusted process plumbing, never model input. Client credentials, TLS keys and offline drafts use protected storage; do not inherit owner secrets into workers.

**`internal/storage`** — Own the SQLite writer, consistent reads, transaction Unit, migrations and atomic event outbox.

Expose Config{Path string; BusyTimeout time.Duration}; Open(context.Context,Config) (contract.Database,error). Caller must hold platform installation lock. Implement StartGeneration(context.Context) (int64,error) and Generation(context.Context) (int64,error) on Database; assembly calls StartGeneration once after migrations and before serving under held ownership. SQLite driver family is modernc.org/sqlite; integration pins exact release. Migrate only with exclusive ownership; validate per-owner monotonic versions and migration SHA256, reject changed applied migration. Enforce owner table namespaces through review and migration validation; application supplies actor/scope and never exposes raw Unit externally. Implement ReadOnly guard in Unit.ExecContext/Emit; consistent snapshot Reader on one connection. Write serializes, starts short explicit transaction, calls callback once, commits state/events together, rolls back on failure/panic. SQL busy waits are bounded. Event sequence persisted increasing globally, payload redacted and authorized by evidence owner before exposure. Database.Events is trusted internal raw feed and not directly public. Backup uses actual consistent SQLite backup mechanism, not copy of a live DB main file. No domain schemas in this package.

**`internal/identity`** — Own principals, grants, authentication metadata, credential references and immediate revocation.

Own identity_principals, identity_grants, identity_credentials and immutable revocation records. Hash authentication tokens with a suitable one-way token verifier; raw bytes reside only in platform custody. Runtime principal/grant administration is explicitly authorized under current authority; cannot smuggle a permission expansion through principal.update or revoked credential reattachment. Principal scope and delegated grants can only fit the delegator's ceiling. Separate agent/client/worker/service/human kinds. Same-user OS access is installation trust boundary, never a claim of tenant isolation. Provision accepts only a helper-verified opaque reference for the requested principal. New credentials cannot be returned as model-visible bytes. Authentication checks revocation and expiry on every request; physical claims recheck current state. Retain revocations through backup rewind. Internal bootstrap is callable only from installation under exclusive uninitialized mode; internal promote accepts deterministic qualification bound to prior rule/ceiling and cannot approve evidence itself.

**`internal/configuration`** — Own organizations, chiefs, teams, projects, worker definitions, bindings, drafts, plans, revisions and the sole definition compiler.

Own configuration_* tables for effective entities and immutable revision/plan lineage; other domains keep their own effective slices activated through their internal owner methods. Export schema is zatiti.organization/v1: installation_id, organization identity/base_revision, teams, projects, workers, skill_refs, bindings, connections metadata, policies, schedules, responsibilities, memory_bindings, execution_profiles, budgets, extensions. Include no credentials, task history or live operations. Cross-installation references explicitly rebind; preserve stable IDs or report collisions. Draft input changes use kind discriminator and full typed definition plus explicit action; zero expected_version only for creation, nonzero for existing. Plans seal complete candidate, base head, dependency/prerequisite versions, compiler/schema versions, authority delta and decisions. Apply reads old authority first, validates every owner, rechecks head/dependencies and activates all slices + revision/event atomically. No network in compiler. Ordinary typed create/update invokes _configuration.stage; bootstrap is sole uninitialized special case. Organization creation stages org/chief as one bundle and exactly one designated chief per active org. Parent tree must be acyclic; keys scoped; workers have one home org. Replacement preserves org identity/memory/history. Moves recheck inherited policy/budgets/bindings and explicitly preserve old private-memory boundaries; they cannot widen active-run authority. Parent reports require explicit reporting binding. Organization archive disables admission first; unresolved runs/artifacts/effects block final destructive removal. Omission never deletes. Definitions remain exportable even when executable prerequisites unavailable; executable activation names missing connection/profile/price. Bootstrap chief may have null profile/limits and cannot run paid work.

**`internal/skills`** — Own immutable skill versions, safe import validation and sealed evaluation jobs.

Own skills_versions/dependencies/evaluations. SKILL.md import adapter follows published Agent Skills metadata, retains exact instruction/support file bytes and provenance/license, and stores Zatiti execution schemas/tool requirements separately. Imported text/frontmatter never installs permission. File enumeration/extraction is local IO phase with strict total/entry/path limits before publication. Reject traversal, symlink escape, devices, duplicate/case collisions, cycles and expansion bombs; do not run any imported script. Imported version starts draft; activation via compiler and explicit bindings only. Evaluations become bounded tasks/effects with pinned evaluator identity/version, sealed fixtures, candidate/model/profile/limits. Store actual observations separately from self-authored tests. Changes invalidate only dependent qualifications through policy. Expose accurate evaluation job status/artifact evidence; failed/skipped evaluation grants nothing.

**`internal/connections`** — Own trusted tool contracts, connection definitions, validation freshness and credential setup challenges.

Own connections_contracts/connections/validations/challenges. Built-in trusted adapter contracts only; external MCP discovery/imported plugins do not install runnable code. Tool schema/account/destination/version changes require explicit candidate and qualified contract, never silent fallback. Connection create/update stages through compiler. Probe/rotation/setup remote work uses prepared governed effect or trusted local helper, not network inside Unit. Challenge begin/status/complete/cancel is typed and versioned with expiry; bind challenge to initiating principal, account and connection. Complete accepts opaque helper receipt only, verify it internally; no pasted OAuth code/token. Browser consent link is an actionable external prerequisite, not approval evidence. Same-account rotation distinct from substitution; account mismatch produces exact review/new configuration. Revoke immediately blocks claim and leaves pending physical outcomes visible. Model disclosure requires active destination/classification binding; lowering classification or changing provider requires old authority. Never put raw provider body or secret in diagnostics. Validation validity is exact connection version/account/scopes and expires at configured profile bound.

**`internal/policy`** — Own deterministic authority intersection, standing/exact-review policy and earned autonomy.

Own policy_definitions/restrictions/promotion_rules/qualifications and immutable evaluation evidence links. Policy rules are interpreted bounded declarative conditions only. Supported condition keys: max_cost (Money), required_classification (enum), not_before/expires_at (UTC), required_tool_version (Ref), required_worker_id (ID), required_review (bool); reject unknown executable conditions. Intersect current principal grants, hierarchy ceilings, project/binding, worker/task envelope, restrictions and current resources. Explicit deny wins; missing required condition refuses admission. Default publication/outbound messages/merge/deploy/account substitution/permission expansion require eligible owner review absent narrower prior standing policy. Expansion always under old policy. Promotions bind capability/destination/worker/model/tool/skill versions/window/rule version and independently established evidence; workers cannot approve own evidence, change evaluator/criteria or widen ceiling. Permit automatic narrow grant only under previously approved rule. Relevant changes invalidate affected qualification before new admission; incidents immediately restrict/demote before continued work. Human-required classes persist until owner explicitly changes governing rule. Model summaries and memory judgments are evidence candidates, never policy authority.

**`internal/reviews`** — Own exact reviews, eligibility checks, immutable decisions and delegated review authority.

Own reviews_requests/decisions/delegations. Review preview is the actual immutable Action, not a model summary. Digest binds account/destination/content/media hashes/timing/preconditions/config/tool versions, including repository head and automation consequences. Recheck principal kind/current grant, expiry/version/action digest, optional proposer separation on decide and on effect claim. Agent cannot satisfy human-required review through CLI, claimed boolean or acting as a different profile. Human credentials in a human-authorized process do not prove physical human presence. Delegation cannot broaden eligible class, scope or authority. Changed action creates a new review or invalidates old one; keep history. Manual task acceptance is a separate eligible task operation and remains distinctly labeled.

**`internal/accounting`** — Own budget definitions, atomic reservations and exact cost/uncertainty ledgers.

Own accounting_limits/reservations/entries. Reserve installation, ancestor organizations from root down, project, worker and root task in stable order under one caller transaction. Count model/evaluation/retry/delegation/Serenity spend and concurrency under same limits. Exact integer currency micro-units; rational price numerator/denominator and checked ceil for reservations, never floating-point money. Currency mismatches and overflow fail input/prerequisite, missing price refuses paid admission. Proposed defaults do not grant paid spending. Keep spent/reserved/estimated/unknown distinct; unknown physical effects retain reservations. Settlement can release only established unused bound; unknown/advisory external spend cannot be presented as zero or enforced hard cap. Budget expansion stages configuration under current old authority. Root/ancestor caps are shared across children, not copied to each child as an independent allowance.

**`internal/tasks`** — Own durable outcomes, immutable accepted contracts, dependency graph and narrowing delegation.

Own tasks_tasks/dependencies/acceptance/history. States: draft→ready→running→verifying→succeeded or failed; running/ready/verifying may wait with explicit reason and resume to prior admissible state; authorized cancel records intent first, terminal cancelled after stop/fencing disposition. Retry from failed/cancelled creates a new run/attempt under same accepted contract after recovery prerequisites. A worker cannot transition directly to succeeded. Parent success checks explicit required child acceptance, not merely child exit. Prevent dependency cycles. Seal verifier code/version, inputs and expected observations before execution; pending input edits require version and cannot replace accepted verifier in flight. Independent verification runs trusted pinned code through an explicitly qualified verifier runner with artifacts isolated from worker rewriting. V1 built-ins: artifact presence/digest/schema and repository patch check using pinned controlled verification command/profile; arbitrary worker-supplied verifier code is never executed as acceptance authority. Manual acceptance requires eligible configured principal and distinct manual flag. Direct user and chief assignment update same versioned task. Delegation intersects tools/destinations/project data/deadline and shares root budgets; enforce finite depth/count/concurrency/planner/model/time limits.

**`internal/scheduling`** — Own durable schedules, responsibility reasoning cycles, occurrence identities and wake conditions.

Own scheduling_definitions/responsibilities/wakes/occurrences/cycles. Scheduler is driven only by controller; no goroutine scheduler in service constructor or external fleet. Cron syntax is five-field minute/hour/day-of-month/month/day-of-week with IANA time zone; when both day fields restricted, use OR semantics. Repeated local time during DST uses UTC occurrence identity, admit each defined distinct instant once; nonexistent spring-forward local occurrence skipped. Default misfire coalesces one newest eligible missed occurrence within catch_up_seconds; older misses recorded skipped. Empty catch-up window means no catch-up. Occurrence key is schedule ID + pinned template version + UTC instant (or durable event ID for event wake). Recheck pause/cancel/reply condition at transactional admission; authenticated explicit reply events only, no external chat ingestion. Persist task creation, occurrence key and next wake atomically. Responsibilities define signals/triggers, finite per-cycle and aggregate limits, minimum reconsideration interval, pause/escalation conditions and durable outputs even on idle cycles. No arbitrary unbounded polling; controller bounded tick uses injected clock. Pause responsibility independently of unrelated work. Safe mailbox/reply wake admission is deduplicated.

**`internal/messaging`** — Own conversations, durable mailboxes, participant disclosure and meaningful activity projections.

Own messaging_conversations/messages/recipients/receipts/read_markers. Group membership is conversation state, not organization membership, grant or memory binding. Authorize body/attachment disclosure for all recipients before delivery; do not retroactively disclose restricted history on joining. Messages have stable ID, authenticated sender, recipients/scope/task refs. Ack after durable target inbox admission, retry deduplicates ID with content hash; different content under same ID conflicts. Workers ingest at safe step boundary; idle resume uses scheduling/execution ownership, not separate task graph. User requests/chief assignments call versioned task operations with shared task identity. Content is untrusted and cannot change grants or verifier. Persist user messages and actual delivered agent input for reconstructable owned model context. Distinguish meaningful human-facing event from routine reasoning/coordination: quiet internal work does not reorder chats, mark unread or notify. Projection action cards derive committed controller operation/task/review state; text claims are not state. Bootstrap pinned personal-chief conversation. Server scopes all conversation list/hierarchy filters, not only UI.

**`internal/execution`** — Own runs, executor attempts, leases, hosted loop context, cooperative protocol and verification coordination.

Own execution_runs/attempts/leases/checkpoints/context_lineage/verification_jobs. Run pins effective configuration and task inputs; attempt owns executor/lease/generation/reservation/output disposition. Concurrent claim must choose one current owner, replay lost ack returns same lease. Default heartbeat interval 15s, lease 60s capped by deadline; no revival after expiry/generation change. Stale lease fences Zatiti mutation but does not prove external process death; replacement blocks on explicit conflicting-resource/effect recovery. Hosted loop uses responses adapter only through effects; store all model-visible user messages/tools/results/memory/instructions/agent messages before dispatch. Compaction persists source lineage and actual compacted context artifact. Parse model tool proposals as untrusted typed requests and authorize through effects. Limits apply each step including continuation/evaluation. Cooperative claims return pinned task/context/bindings/capabilities and advisory usage disclaimer, never dispatch credential or owner secrets. Reports bind exact worker/attempt/lease/generation; independent verifier controls task completion. V1 verifier runner executes only accepted pinned verifier profiles in controlled environment, captures observations/artifact hashes, and cannot be replaced by reported worker checks. Cancellation requests owned-loop interrupt and retains unknown physical effects. Own attempt admission counter and release only safe concurrency resources; uncertain cost reservation stays in accounting.

**`internal/effects`** — Own immutable actions, logical effects, physical attempts, dispatch claims and reconciliation history.

Own effects_actions/operations/attempts/claims/observations/obligations. Persist exact action before any dispatch. Action preconditions support repository_head, expected_resource_versions, not_before, expires_at and allowed_automation; tool contract fixes allowed keys and parameter schema. Unknown preconditions fail. States prepared→awaiting_review/ready/denied; ready→executing after claimed admitted attempt; executing→succeeded/failed/awaiting_confirmation/outcome_unknown. Unsent expired/cancelled/denied allowed only if no earlier attempt can still act. Known provider acceptance is awaiting_confirmation, not success. Admit and claim each recheck relevant current policy and exact review. Current authorization plus budget reservation/attempt/intent/evidence is one transaction. Controller owns actual Invoke and record transaction; service never does network. Idempotency qualifications bind equivalent request/account/destination and real provider retention window. Retry is separate physical attempt with current checks, never hidden adapter retry. Unknown older attempt survives newer failure. Reconciliation bounded read needs own authorization/attempt/cost; authoritative no-effect evidence differs from eventual-consistency not-found. Compensation/replacement new linked operation with independent review. Late contradictory evidence appends explicit correction/dispute; immutable observations never rewritten. Expose unknown status honestly to UI/CLI/MCP/backup.

**`internal/memory`** — Own scoped memory bindings, governed Serenity jobs and promotion/retraction lineage.

Own memory_brains/bindings/jobs/intents/promotions/reconciliation, not canonical Serenity claims store. Distinct brain for each worker/org and installation, including separate personal-chief/root-org/install brain. Private restricted project knowledge stays in narrower bound brain or governed artifact, never leaked into broadly readable org brain. Select authorized brains before recall/model composition; current scope/grants/bindings and revocation matter at retrieval. Parentage/group membership no implicit read. Recall is potentially paid disclosure: effect admission/reservations govern recall/composition/embedding/extraction/curation; required unenforceable bounds make mode unavailable or explicitly advisory only where policy permits. Store actual selected context artifact retaining source/confidence/version/freshness. Cross-brain reads are not atomic snapshot; minimum unavailable freshness waits/refuses. Chief automatic curation stays within standing source disclosure and destination curate/write authority, budgets and evidence. Promotion creates new claim linked source brain/claim version/evidence/curator/redaction; copied statements not independent corroboration. Corrections/retractions create durable downstream obligations. Immediate revocation excludes future retrieval but cannot erase past disclosures/Git/backups/history. Persist writer intent and adapter command identity BEFORE dispatch to sole writer per brain. Lost ack reconciles qualified writer disposition, never blind repeat. Memory.inspect must be an authorized local read-facade query with no external paid work; if not available return prerequisite_missing directing caller to recall job. Backup manifests include brain revisions and key prerequisites; restore paused pending reconciliation.

**`internal/artifacts`** — Own immutable artifact metadata, resumable bounded uploads and integrity-visible byte access.

Own artifacts_metadata/uploads/chunks/pins/faults. BlobStore owns bytes/encryption and filesystem operations. Use local IO prepare/perform/finish interface to stream/stage/hash/publish outside Unit; publish file before committing metadata. Upload begin binds caller/scope/expected size/hash/classification/media type. Chunk requires exact contiguous offset or identical existing chunk replay, validates decoded <=1 MiB and chunk digest, different replay conflicts. Finish checks total bytes/hash, publishes CAS and then metadata/event atomically. Crash after file publish creates reclaimable orphan; after metadata but missing bytes yields visible artifact_fault and blocks success. Never accept server file paths. Range reads authorize metadata/classification then verify integrity before bounded disclosure; returned base64 reflects actual bytes. Sensitive bytes encrypted with external key; metadata hashes not proof of external custody. Retention pins unresolved work/context/verifier/backup references; staging GC only unreferenced expired items. Disk pressure pauses producing work, never erases uncertainty.

**`internal/evidence`** — Own durable command replay, authorized event reads and receipts projected from actual evidence.

Own evidence_commands/receipts/retention_pins; storage owns append-only transactional event/outbox records. Event/command outputs must authorize scope/principal and redact before persistence where possible. Keys bind principal/op/version/canonical request hash, same payload returns original complete/accepted/failed disposition, different content conflicts. Reserve identity and successful state in one writer transaction. Application records rejected mutation disposition separately after rollback with concurrency-safe same-key behavior. Retain keys >=30 days AND as long as any unresolved obligation depends on them. Event cursor scopes filters/principal and snapshot; authenticated opaque token expiry explicit, new snapshot required after retention gap. Storage.Events is trusted raw feed, not a bypass endpoint. Receipts link immutable decisions/provider observations/artifact digests, not worker assertion or log text. Arbitrary secret recognition/infallible history is not claimed; host/DB admin outside threat model. No pruning unresolved evidence to appear healthy.

**`internal/installation`** — Own bootstrap, installation restriction/maintenance state, health, encrypted backup and paused restore jobs.

Own installation_state/jobs/manifests/recovery_obligations. Initialize only local OS-authorized uninitialized destination under exclusive lock. Trusted helper creates owner secret outside transaction, then one bootstrap transaction initializes identity + root organization/chief + distinct memory brains + pinned conversation and evidence. Handle crash between helper and transaction with opaque pending bootstrap intent and recover/cleanup without exporting token; refuse reinitialization. Init selects secure store and creates metadata only, no paid model until configured. Bootstrap MCP mode ends after success and cannot become admin session. Maintenance/pause is immediate acknowledged restriction; drains/fences owned work, preserve unknown effects. Backup IO obtains SQLite consistent backup plus pinned artifact manifest/brain revisions at quiesced boundary, encrypts and verifies whole bundle before completed. Backups use schema zatiti.backup/v1: installation_id, generation, database_digest, artifact manifest entries, brain revisions, retained command/revocation obligations and opaque key prerequisites. Never include decrypting master keys in same bundle. Restore uploaded reference only, maintenance exclusive ownership, validate integrity/version/keys, starts paused. Preserve both backup and later durable revocation/command/claimed-effect obligations across rewind: before restore export an encrypted current recovery overlay, merge monotonically after restore; fail closed on unresolved conflicts and keep overlay. Reconcile pending effects/memory writes before resume; a database rewind cannot undo providers. Doctor names missing provider/price/profile/Serenity/platform limitations without secrets. Local IO executor handles backup/helper work; no IO in Unit.

**`internal/registry`** — Own typed operation registration, collision checks, discovery, schema/OpenAPI generation and parity enumeration.

Expose New([]contract.Module) (*Registry,error), Lookup(string,int64) (contract.Descriptor,contract.Handler,error), Public() []contract.Descriptor, OpenAPI() ([]byte,error), and Bind generic helper exactly as shared contract. Implement capabilities as registry-owned Module; dependency-free descriptor discovery avoids recursive self-registration. Freeze public IDs/CLI/MCP names and schemas from embedded catalog. Validate unique IDs/version, owner, exact DTO schemas, dot/underscore name collisions, complete mappings, descriptor mode and submission semantics. Internal descriptors never appear in Public/OpenAPI/CLI/MCP or accepted public routing. OpenAPI 3.1 emits local schemas, error/result envelopes, request bodies and explicit accepted references. Generated client-facing catalog is derived from runtime typed registry, never another behavior authority. Baseline functionality cannot depend on optional MCP resources/prompts.

**`internal/application`** — Own authenticated operation execution, transaction composition, internal port allowlists and durable submission replay.

Expose New(contract.Database,*registry.Registry,contract.Authenticator,contract.Clock,contract.IDSource) (*Application,error); Invoke(context.Context,contract.Actor,string,contract.Request) (contract.Result,error); Internal(context.Context,contract.Actor,contract.Scope,contract.Invocation) (contract.Payload,error); Authenticate(context.Context,[]byte) (contract.Actor,error); AuthenticateCertificate(context.Context,contract.Digest) (contract.Actor,error); Ports() contract.Ports. Application consumes only registry/contract, never imports domain packages. Expose NewPorts() *PortRouter, (*PortRouter).For(string) contract.Ports, and Bind(*Application) error for the exact two-phase assembly specified in common contract. Composition registers modules and injects app Ports using a constructor-safe late-bound dispatcher; no service calls until assembly complete. Public Invoke derives Unit scope from validated input plus referenced resource, revalidates authenticated actor, rejects internal operation. Gate _policy.check for every public capability; exceptions only bootstrap/capabilities as explicitly specified. Create mutation command identity/replay before stale checks; invoke handler in same ordered transaction; wrap result. Internal method callable only trusted controller scope, checks service principal and allowed entrypoints; ordinary domain Ports calls retain same actor/Unit and caller stack. Enforce catalog callers/visibility/mode, no recursive operation loop, no impersonation. Separate local IO prepare/perform/finish paths for explicitly registered IO modules; repeat authorization and version check at final metadata publication/disclosure. An accepted external job is not dispatched in request transaction. Record known refusal after rollback without losing dedupe concurrency. Bootstrap invokes shared installation initializer with special local capability granted by owner lock only.

**`internal/controller`** — Own one controller lifetime, adapter dispatch, durable background work and recovery coordination.

Expose Config{StateDir string; TickInterval time.Duration; MaxDispatch int}; New(Config,*application.Application,contract.Database,contract.Ownership,map[string]contract.Adapter,contract.Clock) (*Controller,error); Run(context.Context) error; Stop(context.Context) error. Entrypoint startup holder acquires platform lock, migrates DB and advances generation before constructing controller/listener; controller receives held Ownership, does not lock or advance twice, and stops admission on Ownership.Lost. Tick default 1s and max batch 100, bounded by installation concurrency; no scheduler in MCP/desktop/service New. Resolve durable due wakes and pending intents, admit then claim via app.Internal, call exactly one adapter outside tx, record observation. Persist ambiguity when process dies after claim; restart fences old generation and never resends claimed effects blindly. Owned model/memory/probe outcomes delivered to corresponding internal record/observation methods transactionally after effect record using durable deduplicated outbox. Worker loop context bytes staged and published before context pin and effect intent. Trusted verifier runner and local IO background jobs execute outside tx with own pinned accepted profile; record results through task/execution owner. Loss of installation lock/ownership immediately stops admission; graceful shutdown fences or records unresolved work, never invents provider cancellation. Run remains active after desktop disconnect. Secret helper/Serenity process lifecycle belongs controller installation packaging, one writer/brain; refuse unsupported version/capability.

**`internal/server`** — Own private socket HTTP/JSON and explicit remote-desktop mutual TLS transport.

Expose Config{SocketPath string; RemoteAddress string; TLSConfig *tls.Config; MaxBodyBytes int64}; New(Config,*application.Application) (*Server,error); Serve(context.Context) error; Close(context.Context) error. net/http over private Unix socket, no unauthenticated public bind. Selected client credential arrives in Authorization header from secure client storage, never operation input/logs; TLS certificate maps to provisioned principal and still checks current app authority. Versioned POST operation endpoint only; public descriptor allowlist. Request limits/timeouts, strict content type/envelope, bounded responses, request cancellation never assumes accepted command rollback. Authenticate before data lookup. Domain faults encoded in envelope with shared HTTP mapping; protocol malformed bodies mapped invalid_input. No scheduler/DB raw handler, no alternate restore/admin endpoint. Local-only bootstrap route guarded by initializer lock/state; remote cannot bootstrap.

**`internal/client`** — Own shared controller client, secure credential plumbing, reconnect and explicit submission-key retry.

Expose Config{SocketPath string; RemoteURL string; TLSConfig *tls.Config; Timeout time.Duration}; New(Config,contract.CredentialSource) (*Client,error); (*Client).Call(context.Context,string,contract.Request) (contract.Result,error), implementing contract.Operator. Local Unix HTTP transport; explicit remote TLS only for configured desktop. CredentialSource provides header bytes securely per request, never JSON/tool arguments. Strict envelope validation and bounded body reads. Never replace a mutation key after timeout. Auto retries only safe transport connection establishment before any request bytes, or explicit identical submission with same key; unknown ack resolved command.get. Cursor expiry surfaces snapshot_required so caller refreshes snapshot before replay; never fill gap silently. No server file opens, scheduler, model defaults or hidden paid fallback. Cancellation of local wait is not cancellation of accepted command.

**`internal/cli`** — Own Cobra command generation, structured input, deterministic JSON output and process exit mapping.

Expose IO{In io.Reader; Out io.Writer; Err io.Writer}; New(contract.Operator,[]contract.Descriptor,IO) (*cobra.Command,error); Execute(context.Context,[]string,contract.Operator,[]contract.Descriptor,IO) int. Generate all public product commands from descriptor mappings. --input @file / --input - / inline JSON read on client side; all convenience flags fill same schema. --json one complete envelope to stdout, diagnostics stderr; no TTY requirement/silent input prompts. Missing fields fail invalid_input. capabilities shortcut explicit. Transport mechanics serve/mcp serve/help/completion belong cmd assembly and cannot register shadow product operations. Bootstrap uses same initializer via local client mode; credential profile is startup configuration inaccessible in operation arguments. Read artifact bytes into chosen client path only; never send a server path. Preserve command IDs, accepted job refs, version/key/error/cursor semantics. Human rendering derives same result and honest unknown/manual/advisory labels.

**`internal/mcp`** — Own stdio MCP adapter over the common authenticated controller client.

Expose Serve(context.Context,io.Reader,io.Writer,io.Writer,contract.Operator,[]contract.Descriptor) error. Pin official SDK and supported protocol during foundation qualification. stdout only MCP frames, diagnostics stderr. Register each public descriptor as actual typed tool, no shell/CLI wrapper. Common request schema including submission_key is tool input; descriptor data schema wraps common result for output. structuredContent and text JSON equivalent; domain failed => isError, malformed protocol => protocol error. Tool args cannot pick credential profile. Missing controller named controller_unavailable, never start another scheduler. Baseline only initialize/tools/list/tools/call and Zatiti polling; optional sampling/elicitation/resources/prompts/task extensions disabled during qualification. Bootstrap --bootstrap is separate one-time local initializer session, exits after success, cannot become privileged ordinary session. No remote HTTP MCP in v1.

**`internal/adapters/responses`** — Qualified hosted Responses model adapter.

Adapter name responses; profile schema zatiti.responses/v1 has endpoint, model, connection_id, input/output token bounds, max_response_bytes, timeout_seconds, currency, input/output rational rates, capability evidence artifact. Endpoint/provider/model are installation inputs, no default account/model/price. Pin documented Responses wire fields during qualification and preserve full model-visible request artifact. Input Action.parameters includes context_artifact, max_output_tokens, tool_contract_versions; output Observation.evidence includes response_id, output artifact refs, typed tool proposals and finish reason. Never execute model tool proposals in adapter. Enforce explicit disclosure destination/classification and bounded token charges; refuse hard cap if selected API cannot bound required spend. One physical HTTP invocation per Invoke, no mutation retry. Timeout after bytes sent => unknown; provider response acceptance not invented success. Sanitize provider bodies/errors; usage exact observed tokens/prices or unknown. Reconciliation only documented authoritative lookup under qualified retention, otherwise preserve unknown. No hidden provider/model fallback.

**`internal/adapters/github`** — Qualified GitHub repository artifact/publication adapter.

Adapter name github; profile schema zatiti.github/v1 has api_base, allowed_repositories, allowed_actions, max_response_bytes, timeout_seconds, idempotency_profile and automation_constraints. Action.parameters discriminated kind read_repository/create_branch/push_commit/open_pull_request/merge_pull_request; exact repository owner/name, branch/head SHA, base SHA, patch/content artifact hashes, PR title/body artifact and relevant workflow/automation bounds. Restrict v1 publication to qualified forms, unsupported action named capability_unsupported. Review binds exact repo/head/content/timing/account and downstream automation effects; opening PR is consequential. Fetch/check current preconditions immediately before governed call where contract supports, but no unrecorded additional HTTP calls: preflight is its own admitted read. No automatic hidden write retry. Provider accepted/confirmed/unknown distinguished; GitHub eventual not-found cannot prove nonexecution. Repository outputs are governed immutable artifacts, never unbounded controller working-directory shell execution. HTTP redirects cannot widen host/account scope.

**`internal/adapters/httpread`** — Qualified bounded public HTTP reads for research.

Adapter name httpread; profile schema zatiti.httpread/v1 has allowed_origins, max_bytes, timeout_seconds, max_redirects, allowed_media_types. Action.parameters url, method fixed GET, permitted headers excluding raw secret input, expected_media_type. Current authorization/classification/disclosure and cost bound apply even to reads. Enforce response size/time bounds before consuming unlimited bytes, restrict redirect origins and resolve destination at each hop. Refuse local/private/link-local/metadata addresses unless separately explicit installation-authorized destination binding; prevent DNS rebinding by binding validated dial addresses. Each actual physical request/redirect is an accounted effect attempt; simplest v1 qualified profile sets max_redirects=0 and returns prerequisite for an explicit redirected read. Record requested/resolved URL, status, bounded content digest/artifact and freshness for cited brief. No arbitrary shell/browser/script execution.

**`internal/adapters/serenity`** — Qualified public Serenity protocol/read-facade adapter and writer capability report.

Adapter name serenity; profile schema zatiti.serenity/v1 has exact version/commit, public endpoint/brain root mapping, writer ownership, supported operations, cost/disclosure enforcement profile, command status lookup semantics, freshness/index capability, timeout_seconds, max_bytes and backup revision protocol. During foundation integration inspect public upstream API and pin exact source/protocol; never invent a public method from name or import internal packages. Adapter action kind recall/remember/inspect/promote/retract/export_revision, brain_id and stable adapter_command_id plus bounded payload. Brain selected by memory owner authorization, adapter cannot widen query. Canonical writes only one writer per brain; exported Go facade only for compatible reads. Recall may call models and incur charges, so required bound/disclosure enforcement must be qualified before enabling. If actual API cannot provide safe command lookup after lost ack, retain unknown and require explicit reconciliation; do not claim idempotency. Preserve provenance/source/version/freshness in observations. Backup pins real brain revisions, handles Git/history and keys, restore paused pending writer/promotion obligations. Report unsupported guarantees honestly and gate release until required first-release modes qualified.

## Shared foundation contract

# Frozen implementation contract, revision 1

These decisions complete the product specification and bind every scope. Report contradictions with an affected-dependency list and proposed coordinated revision; do not change another owner's interface locally.

## Build and dependency decisions

Module `github.com/zatiti/zatiti`; language `go 1.26.0`; initial toolchain `go1.26.2`. Integration owns go.mod/go.sum. Domains import standard library and internal/contract, not sibling domains. Application composes owner methods through a checked in-process dispatcher: ordinary Go calls, not another server or scheduler.

Library families: Cobra CLI; official MCP Go SDK, handwritten adapter for MCP `2025-11-25`; Fyne v2 native Go desktop; modernc.org/sqlite. Mint is optional build-time tooling and cannot weaken contracts. Hosted provider v1: a specifically qualified OpenAI Responses endpoint/profile, with configured model and prices. Other compatible endpoints remain unavailable until qualified. GitHub uses documented REST over net/http, with mutation retries disabled. Serenity is a separate pinned service using public interfaces only. Integration must resolve exact dependency releases/commits, checksums, licenses and qualification commands in a lock report BEFORE dispatching dependent implementation. These are selected implementation families, not claims that upstream behavior has been qualified. No agent independently substitutes libraries, models, prices, accounts or Serenity APIs. Dependency resolution/qualification is an explicit foundation assignment.

## Shared Go declarations

The contract owner implements these exact declarations. Omitted function bodies are the implementation assignment, not production stubs. Public JSON uses snake_case. Schema-derived DTO names concatenate operation path segments in PascalCase plus Input/Output and live in the owning package. JSON integer => int64, UUID => contract.ID, timestamp => time.Time, optional scalar => pointer, array => slice, explicitly open JSON => json.RawMessage. Unknown fields are rejected.

The registry binds concrete input/output DTO types to descriptors and handlers using `Bind[I, O any](descriptor contract.Descriptor, fn func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. JSON decoding is strict and schema validation precedes execution. Internal cross-owner calls use the same schema-checked Invocation boundary to avoid sibling package imports. They retain the same Unit, actor, scope, generation and transaction; cannot mint authority; and are not exposed as public operations.

## Transaction and ownership rules

Each domain owns tables prefixed with its package name and `_`. Schema and migration bodies inside that namespace are package-private; no other package depends on their layout. Storage owns installation generation, migration metadata and `storage_events`. Evidence owns commands/receipts. Migration ordering is explicit in application assembly. All migrations run under exclusive installation ownership before serving. Cross-owner reads and changes use Ports.Call and the embedded internal schemas. Internal operations have a caller allowlist. The dispatcher detects recursive calls. Queries cannot invoke mutation descriptors. Public clients cannot supply Actor or Unit or invoke internal operations.

One controller, one ordered writer, WAL, foreign keys on every connection, synchronous FULL, busy timeout 5 seconds, consistent read snapshots. Database.Write performs ONE transaction callback attempt with no automatic callback retry. Busy exhaustion returns controller_unavailable/retryable. Unit is valid only inside its callback; no goroutines or retained handles. Unit.Emit appends state-correlated evidence to the storage outbox in the same transaction. Delivery is at least once and consumers deduplicate event IDs. No network/model calls, secret-store access, filesystem streaming or subprocess work inside a Unit. Stage bytes or local helper actions outside transactions, then publish metadata or reconciliation intent through owner methods.

Handler errors roll back the entire transaction. Persist a command refusal in a separate short transaction after rollback where necessary, retaining the original request identity. Query command IDs need not be durable. All mutations return durable command IDs; accepted responses must identify inspectable durable work. Output schemas describe Payload.Data, not the result envelope. Never leak SQL, tokens, provider raw responses or private paths through Fault.

Definition creates/updates/archive stage drafts, including schedules, responsibilities, policies and memory bindings. Only configuration.apply activates definitions. It validates owners' candidate slices, seals base revision/dependencies/requirements, and calls internal activate in the same transaction under old authority. Internal activate is admitted only from the compiler during exact plan application, not by a public flag. Public restrictive pause/revoke/cancel commits immediately without compilation or spending. Archive staging may immediately disable new admissions as an explicitly reported restrictive side effect; final removal waits for obligations.

## Effect and execution rules

Admit: current authorization, exact review/preconditions, all budget reservations, attempt/dispatch intent and evidence atomically. Claim: second transaction rechecks generation/restrictions/expiry and consumes the one-use claim. Invoke the adapter outside transactions. Record: third transaction stores observations, costs or retained uncertainty and events. Each physical call, including reconciliation and retries, has a distinct attempt. Reconciliation is an admitted bounded read and links to the original effect; it does not overwrite history. Internal jobs use explicitly provisioned scoped service identities plus current worker/task restrictions.

Once claimed, crash/timeout/cancel/lease expiry/operator acknowledgement/weak not-found cannot prove nonexecution. Preserve outcome_unknown and its reservation until authoritative evidence. Earlier unknown attempts survive later failures. Mutation SDK/HTTP retries are disabled. Even qualified idempotent retries need fresh authorization and physical-attempt evidence. Trusted adapters resolve credential references outside transactions; no public raw secrets or inherited owner credential environment. Fencing external workers blocks Zatiti mutations but cannot prove their processes stopped.

Task success needs independently established acceptance against pinned verifier code/version, sealed inputs and observations. Worker report/exit zero cannot set succeeded. Defaults: one concurrent attempt/worker, four/installation, 30 minutes/attempt, 100 model steps, eight children, delegation depth three, root deadline 24 hours. Configure explicit currency and finite spend limits before paid work. Amounts are int64 micro-units with checked overflow; rational rates use integer numerator/denominator and round reservations upward. Unknown/advisory usage and missing prices are not zero. Children share root and ancestor budgets.

## Wire conventions and limits

UUIDv4 for new identities; stable UUID references thereafter. SHA-256 lowercase hex digests. Versioned canonical JSON sorts keys, rejects duplicate keys/unknown fields, preserves exact integer values and semantic array order; schema-declared sets sort by stable identity. Preserve exact skill bytes. UTC RFC3339Nano timestamps and int64 versions >=1. Patches and snapshots are distinct; explicit delete only. Inert `extensions` alone permits namespaced extra keys. Scope is explicit and every referenced object is revalidated; no implicit global organization.

Default limits: JSON request 1 MiB; chunk 1 MiB decoded; artifact 256 MiB; skill archive 16 MiB compressed, 64 MiB expanded, 4096 entries, depth 32; list 50/max 200; read 1 MiB; redacted log record 8 KiB; event page 100/max 500; upload expiry 24 hours. Narrowing is allowed, increases require authorized configuration. Reject overflow and unsupported bounds.

Mutations require submission_key (1..128 printable ASCII) except one-time init. Bind principal, operation/version and canonical input hash. Retain >=30 days and through unresolved obligations. Replay identical input returns original disposition BEFORE stale-version validation; changed input => submission_conflict. Concurrent duplicates serialize. Recover lost acknowledgements by command lookup, not a new key. Resource updates require expected_version; apply requires base_revision and plan digest. Creation has no existing version. Opaque authenticated cursors bind principal/scope/filter/order/snapshot and expire explicitly with cursor_expired and snapshot_required=true. Event replay cannot silently omit a gap.

HTTP POST `/v1/operations/{operation_id}` uses the common request envelope. Local HTTP runs over a private Unix socket. Explicit remote desktop uses mutual TLS mapped to current application principals over the same operation contract, never remote MCP. Completed => HTTP 200; accepted => 202. Failed mapping: invalid_input 400, permission_denied 403, not_found 404, stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict/review_required/outcome_unknown/artifact_fault 409, cursor_expired 410, prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported/verification_failed 422, controller_unavailable 503, internal_error 500. Domain failures always include the result envelope.

CLI completed/accepted => exit 0; invalid_input 2; permission_denied/review_required 3; stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict 4; prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported 5; controller_unavailable/outcome_unknown 6; other failures 1. CLI --json emits one envelope to stdout, diagnostics stderr, no implicit prompts. MCP structuredContent is the full envelope, text is equivalent JSON, failed => isError true, malformed protocol => protocol error. Dot-separated operation IDs map to CLI tokens and `zatiti_` MCP names. Exceptions: installation.init => `zatiti init` / `zatiti_installation_init`; capabilities.list => `zatiti capabilities` / `zatiti_capabilities`. Lifecycle steps are individual tools. Tool input never selects a credential profile or accepts raw secrets/unrestricted server paths.

## Completion policy

Write only within the assigned root. Do not edit this prompt, siblings, shared contracts, root dependencies or external acceptance inputs. Implement exact fake dependencies locally; do not return invented production success for unavailable prerequisites. Use controlled providers, deterministic clocks and synthetic fixtures. Preserve expected/observed results and failure evidence. Package tests prove local properties; actual subprocess parity, crash recovery, desktop and adapter qualification prove integration. Z01-Z21 and first-release journeys on macOS/Linux must pass before a release is claimed.

## Local IO, authentication, jobs and verification seams

These additional declarations are part of the SAME frozen contract package (using imports already shown). Implementing an interface does not permit calling it inside a Unit except where the signature explicitly takes Unit/Reader.

```go
type Authenticator interface {
    Authenticate(context.Context, Reader, []byte) (Actor, error)
    AuthenticateCertificate(context.Context, Reader, Digest) (Actor, error)
}
type IOPlan struct {
    ID ID
    Owner string
    Invocation Invocation
    Actor Actor
    Scope Scope
    Generation int64
    ExpectedVersions map[ID]Version
    Prepared json.RawMessage
}
type IOResult struct { Data json.RawMessage; Fault *Fault }
type LocalIO interface {
    Prepare(context.Context, Unit, Invocation) (IOPlan, error)
    Perform(context.Context, IOPlan) (IOResult, error)
    Finish(context.Context, Unit, IOPlan, IOResult) (Payload, error)
}
// Request is the exact VerificationRequest JSON schema embedded in the prompt.
type Verification struct { Request json.RawMessage }
// Document is the exact VerificationResult schema, including independently
// observed checks, pinned identity, task/attempt and staged artifact handoff.
type VerificationResult struct { Document json.RawMessage }
type Verifier interface {
    Verify(context.Context, Verification) (VerificationResult, error)
}
type VerifierDependencies struct { Clock Clock; Blobs BlobStore }
```

Identity Service also implements Authenticator. Application receives this interface explicitly in New; it uses a dedicated read snapshot and never reads identity-owned tables itself. Only the byte-slice credential boundary carries secret authentication material, never Invocation JSON. Zero sensitive buffers after use where practical; no logging. Certificate authentication resolves a preprovisioned credential reference and follows the same current principal/revocation rules.

Artifacts, skills, connections and installation Services also implement LocalIO. The registry detects this interface at assembly and routes ONLY registered local IO operations through Prepare/Perform/Finish: artifact.upload.chunk/finish/cancel/read/export; skill.import; connection.setup.begin/complete/cancel; installation.init/backup/restore. LocalIO handles local bounded files, secure helpers and backup work, never unadmitted provider/model calls. Prepare strictly validates input, versions, identity and authority and records replayable local intent under IOPlan.ID; Perform receives that exact trusted in-memory plan outside transactions, resolves opaque staging/helper references, and returns metadata; Finish rechecks authority/versions/generation and commits result/evidence. IOPlan is never public, accepted from an agent or stored with secrets. Prepared/Data JSON must use the operation's declared schemas plus private owner-local metadata, which no other package reads. No cross-owner business protocol may hide in those private fields. Perform must support safe replay of local staging/publication by plan ID, or preserve an inspectable failed/unknown local obligation. A synchronous read does not return bytes to client until final authorization check. New raw provider writes always use effects, not this interface.

For synchronous local IO mutations, persist command identity plus accepted internal pending disposition at Prepare, then replace pending disposition once at Finish. Concurrent same-key calls join/inspect that same in-progress command and never run duplicate Perform. The controller can recover abandoned local intents using the execution job API. Async backup/export uses the same interface with an inspectable job returned immediately. The artifact.upload.chunk endpoint has a 2 MiB encoded request cap (all other ordinary JSON requests 1 MiB), allowing the specified 1 MiB decoded chunk plus envelope.

Execution owns shared durable jobs (execution_jobs), distinct from runs and physical effects. `_execution.job.create` stores the original owner/operation/input and idempotent source identity; public job.get inspects any authorized job. Controller lists pending jobs, claims generation-bound ownership, invokes the named LocalIO owner outside transactions through its exact plan, and records result/obligation. Network jobs first prepare effects and wait on their recorded outcomes. `_execution.job.record` stores result data matching the originating operation's explicit completion_schema and links actual artifact/operation evidence. Never mark a job succeeded merely because its physical request was accepted.

Tasks calls `_execution.enqueue` with ready pinned task inside the same transaction; execution creates one run for task/version and returns it. `_tasks.ready` also exposes a bounded recovery scan. Execution's verifier constructor is `NewVerifier(contract.VerifierDependencies) (contract.Verifier,error)`. Verify executes outside Unit and returns actual independently established observations under the pinned accepted profile; `_execution.verification.record` rechecks attempt/task/version before changing task state. A forged worker-provided VerificationResult is never accepted through public report. Concrete context/adapter/verification payload schemas are included in relevant prompts.

Administrative effects that have no task use their command/operation ID as an accountable admission root; no fictional worker/task or fabricated task foreign key is required. Accounting skips absent scope dimensions but always reserves installation and present organization ancestors/project limits. Task effects additionally share root_task_id. A profile without enforceable charge bounds cannot claim a hard cap.

Typed handler bindings return `contract.Outcome[O]` so accepted results and page cursors survive typed registration. The frozen Bind signature is `Bind[I, O any](contract.Descriptor, func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. Errors carry Fault and roll back, while accepted/completed status and cursor come from Outcome.

Assembly order: application.NewPorts() returns an unbound *PortRouter; For(owner string) returns an owner-bound contract.Ports without domain calls; construct identity and all other modules with those ports; registry.New(modules); application.New(db, registry, identityAuthenticator, clock, ids); router.Bind(app) exactly once; start serving only after Bind. PortRouter exposes `For(string) contract.Ports` and `Bind(*Application) error`, rejects pre-bind invocation, and never allows a domain to change its bound caller identity. Registry also implements Module for its own capabilities methods. Constructor execution must not query peers or start goroutines.

All native BlobStore objects are encrypted at rest (including public-classification content), because Stage has no classification argument. Metadata publication sets encrypted=true; classification separately governs disclosure. Controller records the raw adapter observation and cost disposition durably first, then publishes StagedOutput bytes outside Unit, then commits artifact metadata and normalized owner callbacks through an outbox consumer. Publication failure is a visible artifact obligation and blocks task/job acceptance; it does not erase a confirmed provider observation or authorize resending. The adapter cannot mint artifact IDs.

Entrypoint assembly owns platform.Acquire -> storage.Open -> Migrate -> Database.StartGeneration, exactly once before controller/server admission. Pass the held contract.Ownership into controller.New; controller never acquires a second lock or advances generation again. Ownership.Lost closes when ownership is lost/released; stop admission immediately. Generation is a persisted local-controller fence, not distributed locking. The installation lock is retained until controller shutdown and DB close.

Remote TLS additionally validates the certificate chain and maps the SHA-256 certificate SPKI fingerprint through application.AuthenticateCertificate(ctx,Digest), which delegates to identity Authenticator.AuthenticateCertificate on a read snapshot. Only a verified TLS peer can enter that API; operation input cannot supply the fingerprint. Store certificate fingerprints as identity-owned authentication metadata on an explicitly provisioned credential reference. If a bearer credential is also supplied, its principal must match the verified certificate principal. No self-asserted certificate name, profile name or fingerprint header grants authority.

Every async operation declares completion_schema separately from its immediate Job response. job.get returns that schema as Job.result only when established; pending jobs omit result. Local IO mutations that may be recovered asynchronously accept either their completed resource output or `{job: Job}` in the descriptor output schema. Bootstrap remains synchronous under its exclusive one-time lock. No unspecified job kind may execute: _execution.job.create requires a registered completion_schema or a specifically registered private local-intent recovery contract.

Evidence retains the complete original result envelope for command replay, including fault message/details/retryability and cursor; projections of status/data/error_code must agree with Command.result. `_evidence.command.finish` takes that exact result. A replay cannot reconstruct a different error or lose an accepted job reference. ScopeRequired lists installation_id where input scope is required; resource-specific organization/project/worker conditions are enforced by the owned operation schemas and current referenced-resource validation, never inferred from a profile name.

Descriptor.Callers carries the exact catalog internal caller allowlist into runtime registration; application enforces this metadata rather than inventing it from operation names. Internal metadata remains available to trusted assembly/registry while public capability output contains public operations only. An empty allowlist never authorizes an internal call.

## Owned product requirements

### R8.2-002 (source section 8.2; primary owner cli)

Every product command accepts structured input through `--input @file.json`, `--input -` for stdin, or an equivalent inline JSON option. Convenient flags may populate that same request schema. Input files are read by the CLI client, not arbitrary paths opened by the controller. `--json` emits exactly one versioned JSON result to stdout; diagnostics go to stderr. Commands do not require a TTY and never silently prompt when input is incomplete. Human rendering and optional interactive helpers use the same requests.

### R8.2-003 (source section 8.2; primary owner cli)

The exceptional capability shortcut is `zatiti capabilities --json`, mapping to `zatiti_capabilities`; the descriptor records its name explicitly. General request example:

### R8.2-004 (source section 8.2; primary owner cli)

```json
{
  "schema": "zatiti.request/v1",
  "submission_key": "demo-org-create-001",
  "input": {"key": "demo", "name": "Demo organization"}
}
```

### R8.2-005 (source section 8.2; primary owner cli)

`zatiti organization create --input @organization.json --json` and `zatiti_organization_create` with these arguments call the same handler. Creating the organization returns its draft and identity; activation follows plan/apply.

### R8.3-002 (source section 8.3; primary owner mcp)

V1 uses stdio with the generated Mint adapter (or an equivalent pinned adapter) and a pinned supported protocol revision. `zatiti mcp serve` connects to the configured local controller as the selected scoped principal. MCP stdout carries protocol frames only; diagnostic logging goes to stderr. Reconnection does not create another controller or restart tasks. A missing controller returns a named availability error; process-start convenience must not hide a second scheduler.

### R8.3-003 (source section 8.3; primary owner mcp)

The server advertises typed tools with input and output schemas. It returns the common result envelope as `structuredContent`, with equivalent serialized JSON in text content for clients that need it. Domain failures use a tool result with `isError: true`; malformed protocol messages use protocol errors. Zatiti specifies this mapping against the [MCP tools contract](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/server/tools).

### R8.3-004 (source section 8.3; primary owner mcp)

Do not require optional client features such as sampling, elicitation, resources, prompts, or protocol-level task extensions for baseline product access. Long work uses Zatiti task/command IDs and polling. Local stdio is the first-release transport; remote HTTP requires a separate authentication and exposure design before support. See the [MCP transport specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/transports) and [official Go SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk).
## Exact operation and dependency schemas

### `artifact.export` v1 — artifacts / public / mutation / local

CLI `zatiti artifact export`; MCP `zatiti_artifact_export`. Submission key: required.

Produce authorized export artifact; client chooses local output path, no server path input.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"}},"required":["scope","id"]}
```
Output data schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"resource":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Job"}},"required":["resource"]}
```

Eventual job result schema (job.get resource.result):
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"resource":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Artifact"}},"required":["resource"]}
```

### Local schema definitions

The schemas above resolve exclusively against this embedded `$defs` object. Input objects reject additional properties except explicitly open schema/data fields. Field semantics are completed by the owned requirements and operation descriptions. Output `resource`, `items`, `draft`, `job`, etc. are literal keys. Pagination cursor lives in the common envelope.

## Local adapter, context, verifier and backup payloads

These local schemas freeze the handoff between execution, adapters and artifact publication. They do not assert upstream compatibility.

These are exact Zatiti-side contracts, not representations of upstream APIs. Adapter implementation translates to a pinned, separately qualified public upstream protocol; unsupported semantics fail capability_unsupported or preserve outcome_unknown.
To validate a named schema, place definitions under the root $defs and reference the selected name. The catalog container uses definitions for packaging only; every embedded #/$defs/Name resolves against that assembled validation document. JSON Schema dialect is 2020-12.
Validate strict objects, formats, explicit field limits, duplicate-key rejection and exact integer bounds. Runtime must also enforce total JSON/artifact byte limits, at most 64 JSON levels and 100000 schema/input nodes; schema documents and dynamic tool arguments cannot escape the qualified local validation dialect.
Opaque references, URLs, headers and diagnostics must never contain secret bytes. Profile configuration is trusted local configuration; public operation arguments cannot install profiles, select a more privileged credential, open an arbitrary server path or replace capability evidence.
Before dispatch, profile capability evidence must match the canonical profile digest computed with the capability_evidence field omitted; self-referential capability evidence and qualification records do not grant authority. The binding/effect owner independently checks current account, scope, destinations, classification, prices and qualified capability.
PhysicalCallEvidence records exactly one physical network request per claimed attempt. request_context identifies the pre-dispatch persisted request. No adapter adds preflight, redirect, polling, SDK retry or model tool execution inside that request; each such external action requires a separate governed attempt.
StagedOutput is an IO handoff, not a published ArtifactRef. Adapter stages bytes and returns staging_ref/digest metadata; controller uses the artifacts owner to publish metadata and replace staged locators with real ArtifactRefs before delivering normalized observations to execution/memory/other domains. output_artifacts may be empty at adapter return and contains the resulting published refs in recorded domain evidence. ArtifactLocator staged references must match exactly one StagedOutput in the same observation. Failed publication remains a visible obligation/fault.
ContextArtifact.messages and each parts array preserve the exact model-visible semantic order. Tool definitions, memory excerpts and injected messages must all appear in the persisted request context before dispatch. Context source artifacts and compaction lineage do not replace retaining the actual selected text. Complete capture is required for owned hosted loops; external capture limitations remain explicit.
Model tool proposals are observations. tool ID/version must match the pinned context tool closure; operation ID/version must be the qualified mapping for that tool. Validate input against that exact schema and apply current authority/review/budgets before a separate operation. Never execute a model proposal directly in an adapter.
Responses input_rate.unit must equal input_token and output_rate.unit output_token; profile currencies and all reported/reserved usage must agree. Round admission reservations upward using checked integer rational arithmetic. Missing or unbounded required charges refuse hard-cap mode. A null/absent upstream usage report maps to unknown/advisory billing, never free success.
GitHubParameters is discriminated by kind. read_repository requires branch for ref, sha for commit/tree/blob, and pull_request_number for pull_request; irrelevant resource selectors are rejected. Relative repository paths and branch syntax receive Git-aware validation. Profile allowed_actions must be separately qualified against real API preconditions and downstream automation.
GitHub push_commit publishes an already prepared exact commit SHA in one qualified physical request. Creating remote blobs, trees or commits is not hidden inside Invoke: it needs an explicit separately admitted decomposition and qualification before enabling that route. Preflight evidence cannot substitute for atomic provider preconditions where the action requires protection against a race; refuse unsupported guarantees.
GitHub open_pull_request and merge_pull_request are consequential effects bound to exact account/repository/head/base/content/timing/automation constraints. A successful HTTP response or accepted request is not independently assumed confirmed completion; response interpretation follows the qualified contract. Eventual not-found never proves nonexecution.
HTTPRead v1 max_redirects is exactly zero. Return redirect_location as evidence/prerequisite and require a separately authorized read for the new URL. Validate DNS results and bind validated dial addresses; reject local/private/link-local/metadata targets unless explicitly permitted by an installation-authorized destination binding. Header values reject controls and duplicate header names; Authorization, Cookie and arbitrary raw credential input are excluded.
Serenity profile endpoints/root_ref/writer_owner are opaque locally provisioned mappings, not model-selectable arbitrary filesystem locations. They identify real pinned public protocol/read-facade support. Zatiti never imports upstream internal packages or invents public endpoints from these local operation names.
Serenity recall/remember/promote may incur disclosure or charges. All nested upstream provider destinations and spend must fit enforcement; unsupported enforceable bounds disable the mode or require explicitly permitted advisory use. Promote resolves and authorizes source content before preparing the destination write and retains the source evidence; it does not perform an unaccounted extra source read inside Invoke.
Serenity adapter_command_id is the durable pre-dispatch command identity. Its existence does not prove upstream idempotency: reconcile through qualified status semantics, retaining unknown after lost acknowledgement if authoritative lookup is unavailable. One writer owner per brain. Retract removes active recall and leaves historical_erasure false; promotion correction lineage remains a durable memory-owner obligation.
Verification profiles are installation-owned and pinned before task execution. command_id, runner_profile and environment_profile resolve only to prequalified local verifiers; no request supplies executable paths or argv. ArtifactVerifierProfile runs presence/digest/schema checks; RepositoryVerifierProfile runs the pinned controlled patch/check profile outside Unit. A worker cannot alter profile bytes, accepted inputs or result authority.
VerificationResult.independent=true is necessary structure, not trust evidence: only the trusted runner may submit that result through its internal admission identity. Match task/attempt, acceptance digest, verifier identity/version/digest and request artifact before accepting. Passed requires all sealed expected checks observed as required; unavailable, interrupted, worker assertion and process exit zero alone cannot succeed a task. Manual acceptance uses the separate task operation and never fabricates an independent result.
BackupManifest is inside an authenticated encrypted bundle; it never includes decrypting master keys. archive_entry values are normalized relative entries with no traversal, absolute paths, symlinks, duplicate/case collisions or devices. Verify database/artifact/brain digests and qualified revision exports before marking backup verified. Large manifests stream through bounded artifact IO, not public JSON request bodies.
Restore starts paused under exclusive maintenance, validates installation binding and key prerequisites, and retains current recovery overlay before rewinding. Merge revocations, durable command identities, claimed/unknown effects, reservations and memory obligations monotonically via their owners; fail closed on conflict and retain the overlay. Overlay record artifacts must be included/pinned and encrypted. No database/brain rewind is represented as undoing an external effect.

## Named acceptance cases

Tests are implementation deliverables, not claims of already executed qualification. Retain expected/observed results, exact source/config/tool versions and failure evidence.

Actual binary init/status/serve/MCP subprocess, signal shutdown, missing controller, one scheduler, stdout cleanliness, credential environment isolation.

## Delivery

Implement production behavior and meaningful local tests within scope. Report files changed, commands actually run, observed results, unresolved dependency qualifications and contract defects. A missing dependency may use an exact local fake for development; production must return a named prerequisite/unsupported error instead of fake success. Integration owns shared dependency changes, real assembly, cross-package proving and landing. Do not advertise release or client/platform support from compilation alone.
