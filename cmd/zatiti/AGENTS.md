# Implementation assignment: `cmd/zatiti`

Generated specification revision 17; source digest `f77034332a96396a9f88395f71ff528f051f96f35b398629236dd00bc731c08f`. This file is committed implementation context. Do not independently edit it. Everything required from the product specification and adjacent interfaces is embedded below; no RFC copy is required.

## Mission and scope

Assemble controller/CLI/MCP binary and local bootstrap/helper mechanics.

Write scope: **`cmd/zatiti/` only**, excluding this generated AGENTS.md. Go package name: `main`. Ownership kind: entrypoint; integration wave: 3.

Allowed production imports from this repository: `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/contract`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/platform`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/storage`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/identity`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/configuration`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/skills`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/connections`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/policy`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/reviews`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/accounting`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/tasks`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/scheduling`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/messaging`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/execution`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/effects`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/memory`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/artifacts`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/evidence`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/installation`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/registry`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/application`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/controller`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/server`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/client`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/cli`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/mcp`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/adapters/responses`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/adapters/github`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/adapters/httpread`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/adapters/serenity`, `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/packaging`. Tests may use interfaces/fakes defined locally and, once available, storage-backed temporary fixtures; integration owns cross-package tests. No sibling raw SQL. No root dependency edits except the integration exception stated in its own brief.

## Implementation decisions and acceptance focus

Own main.go and local entrypoint helpers only. Wire concrete modules to registry/app Ports, storage/platform, adapters/controller/server. Supply the installation database seam exactly as the shared contract states: define a private wrapper type whose only method is Backup(context.Context, io.Writer) error delegating to the opened contract.Database, and pass installation.WithDatabaseBackup(wrapper) to installation.New. Never pass the Database value itself, and give the capability to no other module, adapter, server or client. main delegates run(ctx,args,stdin,stdout,stderr) int for testability. Commands serve and mcp serve are transport mechanics; public operations come only from registry-generated CLI. Explicit config/profile selection outside model-visible operation arguments. serve owns always-on lock/scheduler; mcp serve uses existing controller and scoped client, no database writer. init and mcp serve --bootstrap call shared local initializer under one-time lock, secret helper local IO, return metadata and end bootstrap mode. No automatic launch of arbitrary client/harness. Configure slog redacted stderr/protected files, signals and bounded shutdown. Root dependencies and CI belong integration, not this scope. Revision 6: on every serve startup recover the committed OwnerCredential StoreRef, verify its custody, and publish pre/post-bootstrap desktop discovery without rerunning init or minting authority; preserve CLI profile compatibility from that same ref. Revision 9: terminal and installed GUI helpers use one trusted Go receipt engine, stable keyed setup.begin/setup.complete submissions and command.get/status reconciliation. Build a Mac-specific Go c-archive from this root and statically link it into the standalone signed Swift/AppKit helper: in-process Prepare(nonsecret IDs), Commit(handle, credential pointer/length), Cancel(handle) C ABI; Swift never implements HMAC or sends a secret to another process. Bound provider input to 4096 UTF-8 bytes before allocating unbounded strings. GUI process receives only fixed UUID args and resolves protected default discovery/Keychain and secret:master itself; no provider key, header or master-key selector crosses Dart, argv or environment. Bootstrap composition injects platform.ProvisionMacMasterKey before any installed controller launch; fixed LaunchAgent selects keychain and secret:master against default state. Revision 10: distribution is an allowed production import only for trusted bootstrap composition. Inject platform.ProvisionMacMasterKey through packaging.MacMasterKeyProvisioner for the fixed default state; never import platform from packaging. Protected helper intent may retain only bounded nonsecret replay identities/keys/account/credential name plus opaque ref and challenge version/expiry, and must bind exact mutation bytes before dispatch. Revision 11: the signed installed helper owns Serenity OAuth discovery, dynamic public-client registration, numeric-loopback callback, S256 PKCE, browser opening and code exchange. Its existing Go bridge owns Keychain, exact keyed challenge and verified hosted binding; Swift/Dart receive no code or token. Provider-key capture remains a separate helper mode.

Local proving focus: Actual binary init/status/serve/MCP subprocess, signal shutdown, missing controller, one scheduler, stdout cleanliness, credential environment isolation. Rev9: strict submission-key fake, bounded input, lost acknowledgement and crash-after-Put repair with no secret in output or public operation input. Rev11: callback state/port/replay, browser denial, bounded discovery, token-secret absence and crash/lost-response reconciliation.

## Incoming and outgoing boundaries

Incoming callers: entrypoint/assembly or tests via the explicit Go API.

Outgoing owner calls: none; use only declared Go dependency interfaces. Each exact input/output schema appears below. Calls retain current Unit/authority; owner allowlists are mandatory.

### Imported package APIs and behavior

These briefs are embedded so you need not read a sibling prompt to discover its incoming API. Implement only your own package.

**`internal/platform`** — Own OS locks, protected local configuration, secret custody, encrypted blob files and client secure storage.

Expose Config{StateDir string; CredentialBackend string; MasterKeyRef string; MaxArtifactBytes int64}; Open(Config) (*Platform,error); (*Platform).Acquire(context.Context) (contract.Ownership,error); Secrets() contract.SecretStore; Blobs() contract.BlobStore; Close() error. SecretStore and BlobStore implementations are separate objects; use OS keychain/Secret Service or explicitly provisioned headless key source. State root 0700, sensitive files 0600, private Unix socket 0600, forbid unsafe symlink traversal and network-filesystem claims. A held exclusive OS file lock spans controller lifetime; close/release is explicit. No plaintext fallback if secure store unavailable. Encrypt sensitive blob bytes using authenticated encryption with per-object nonce and authenticated digest/metadata; master key lives outside SQLite/backups. Stage returns opaque staging identity, digest of plaintext exact bytes, and bounded size. Publish is atomic and durable before metadata reference; repeated identical publication is idempotent. Open decrypts/verifies full integrity before returning bounded requested bytes; missing/corrupt bytes fail artifact_fault. Never return local absolute paths through product interfaces. Disk pressure rejects new artifact-producing admissions and preserves referenced/unknown-obligation data. Export secret helper support through local trusted process plumbing, never model input. Client credentials, TLS keys and offline drafts use protected storage; do not inherit owner secrets into workers. Revision 6: own protected atomic desktop.json publication and the nonsecret KeychainLocator for a verified opaque owner StoreRef; never expose owner bytes through metadata. Revision 9: implement ProvisionMacMasterKey(ctx,stateDir) error for fixed default Mac state only: create/validate 0700 state and retained 0600 instance.id, create-only 32-byte CSPRNG generic-password account master under the existing instance-local login-Keychain service, or read/validate an existing exact 32-byte item without overwrite. Return only readiness/error, zero temporary bytes where feasible, fail locked/ACL/refused/malformed closed. Installed GUI helper opens the same default state/Keychain with fixed secret:master; prove signed helper/controller access and upgrade continuity without a plaintext or data-protection-keychain substitution. Revision 11: retain OAuth refresh/access tokens and PKCE/state material only in protected installation-local secret custody; refresh rotation is atomic from the controller perspective and a lost refresh response fails to re-sign-in rather than reusing a spent refresh token.

**`internal/storage`** — Own the SQLite writer, consistent reads, transaction Unit, migrations and atomic event outbox.

Expose Config{Path string; BusyTimeout time.Duration}; Open(context.Context,Config) (contract.Database,error). Caller must hold platform installation lock. Implement StartGeneration(context.Context) (int64,error) and Generation(context.Context) (int64,error) on Database; assembly calls StartGeneration once after migrations and before serving under held ownership. SQLite driver family is modernc.org/sqlite; integration pins exact release. Migrate only with exclusive ownership; validate per-owner monotonic versions and migration SHA256, reject changed applied migration. Enforce owner table namespaces through review and migration validation; application supplies actor/scope and never exposes raw Unit externally. Implement ReadOnly guard in Unit.ExecContext/Emit; consistent snapshot Reader on one connection. Write serializes, starts short explicit transaction, calls callback once, commits state/events together, rolls back on failure/panic. SQL busy waits are bounded. Event sequence persisted increasing globally, payload redacted and authorized by evidence owner before exposure. Database.Events is trusted internal raw feed and not directly public. Backup uses actual consistent SQLite backup mechanism, not copy of a live DB main file; it is reached by installation through the one-method contract.DatabaseBackup capability, is called outside any Unit while the controller keeps the database open and serving, and must yield one consistent snapshot without requiring the caller to hold a transaction. No domain schemas in this package.

**`internal/identity`** — Own principals, grants, authentication metadata, credential references and immediate revocation.

Own identity_principals, identity_grants, identity_credentials and immutable revocation records. Hash authentication tokens with a suitable one-way token verifier; raw bytes reside only in platform custody. Runtime principal/grant administration is explicitly authorized under current authority; cannot smuggle a permission expansion through principal.update or revoked credential reattachment. Principal scope and delegated grants can only fit the delegator's ceiling. Separate agent/client/worker/service/human kinds. Same-user OS access is installation trust boundary, never a claim of tenant isolation. Provision accepts only a helper-verified opaque reference for the requested principal. New credentials cannot be returned as model-visible bytes. Authentication checks revocation and expiry on every request; physical claims recheck current state. Retain revocations through backup rewind. Internal bootstrap is callable only from installation under exclusive uninitialized mode; internal promote accepts deterministic qualification bound to prior rule/ceiling and cannot approve evidence itself. Revision 3: _identity.bootstrap accepts optional service_credential_id/service_store_ref so the bootstrap-created controller service principal can receive a credential in the same transaction (an out-of-process controller needs one to authenticate; the in-process explicit-Actor seam does not and may omit them). _identity.authority is gated exactly like every internal operation, by its caller allowlist plus the calling actor being a registered unrevoked principal in the transaction's installation -- never by requiring that actor to already hold the capability named in its own request; do not reintroduce a circular subject-capability check or a standing grant to work around one.

**`internal/configuration`** — Own organizations, chiefs, teams, projects, worker definitions, bindings, drafts, plans, revisions and the sole definition compiler.

Own configuration_* tables for effective entities and immutable revision/plan lineage; other domains keep their own effective slices activated through their internal owner methods. Export schema is zatiti.organization/v1: installation_id, organization identity/base_revision, teams, projects, workers, skill_refs, bindings, connections metadata, policies, schedules, responsibilities, memory_bindings, execution_profiles, budgets, extensions. Include no credentials, task history or live operations. Cross-installation references explicitly rebind; preserve stable IDs or report collisions. Draft input changes use kind discriminator and full typed definition plus explicit action; zero expected_version only for creation, nonzero for existing. Plans seal complete candidate, base head, dependency/prerequisite versions, compiler/schema versions, authority delta and decisions. Apply reads old authority first, validates every owner, rechecks head/dependencies and activates all slices + revision/event atomically. No network in compiler. Ordinary typed create/update invokes _configuration.stage; bootstrap is sole uninitialized special case. Organization creation stages org/chief as one bundle and exactly one designated chief per active org. Parent tree must be acyclic; keys scoped; workers have one home org. Replacement preserves org identity/memory/history. Moves recheck inherited policy/budgets/bindings and explicitly preserve old private-memory boundaries; they cannot widen active-run authority. Parent reports require explicit reporting binding. Organization archive disables admission first; unresolved runs/artifacts/effects block final destructive removal. Omission never deletes. Definitions remain exportable even when executable prerequisites unavailable; executable activation names missing connection/profile/price. Bootstrap chief may have null profile/limits and cannot run paid work. Revision 3: export/import route through _configuration.export.prepare (persists an immutable export snapshot/version plan through the durable execution job ledger before any bytes are staged; no phantom completed job, no blob IO in this transaction) and _configuration.export.record (publishes the exported Job/Artifact through their owning ports after canonical bytes are staged outside the transaction) instead of the prior handler-local ID minting with no owner-backed lookup. Revision 15: execution_profile.qualify accepts a strict ExecutionProfileCandidate whose ResponsesProfileDraft has no capability_evidence field. Pin exact connection version, profile bytes/digest, destination, prices, route and explicit probe cost bound; create one durable qualification job and one effects operation atomically. Do not call a provider from a Unit. Only the controller callback that records the matching physical-call observation may publish CapabilityEvidence and return QualifiedExecutionProfile. Qualification never creates or activates the execution profile; the caller uses ordinary execution_profile.create → plan → explicit apply. Unknown physical outcomes remain unknown and cannot qualify or be retried. Revision 16: persist the pending candidate and its digest before preparing its external effect; expose the candidate only through _configuration.execution_profile.qualification.resolve to Effects. Link one execution job to the resulting effect operation in the same Unit. The controller completion must be idempotent and terminal job state must preserve failed/unknown outcomes.

**`internal/skills`** — Own immutable skill versions, safe import validation and sealed evaluation jobs.

Own skills_versions/dependencies/evaluations. SKILL.md import adapter follows published Agent Skills metadata, retains exact instruction/support file bytes and provenance/license, and stores Zatiti execution schemas/tool requirements separately. Imported text/frontmatter never installs permission. File enumeration/extraction is local IO phase with strict total/entry/path limits before publication. Reject traversal, symlink escape, devices, duplicate/case collisions, cycles and expansion bombs; do not run any imported script. Imported version starts draft; activation via compiler and explicit bindings only. Evaluations become bounded tasks/effects with pinned evaluator identity/version, sealed fixtures, candidate/model/profile/limits. Store actual observations separately from self-authored tests. Changes invalidate only dependent qualifications through policy. Expose accurate evaluation job status/artifact evidence; failed/skipped evaluation grants nothing. Revision 3: _skills.evaluation.record is the sole path that records published verifier evidence against the exact immutable skill version an evaluation names, routed through the durable execution job ledger (execution_jobs) rather than a handler-local completion; a skill or evaluator change since evaluation admission invalidates the evaluation instead of recording it.

**`internal/connections`** — Own trusted tool contracts, connection definitions, validation freshness and credential setup challenges.

Own connections_contracts/connections/validations/challenges. Built-in trusted adapter contracts only; external MCP discovery/imported plugins do not install runnable code. Tool schema/account/destination/version changes require explicit candidate and qualified contract, never silent fallback. Connection create/update stages through compiler. Probe/rotation/setup remote work uses prepared governed effect or trusted local helper, not network inside Unit. Challenge begin/status/complete/cancel is typed and versioned with expiry; bind challenge to initiating principal, account and connection. Complete accepts opaque helper receipt only, verify it internally; no pasted OAuth code/token. Browser consent link is an actionable external prerequisite, not approval evidence. Same-account rotation distinct from substitution; account mismatch produces exact review/new configuration. Revoke immediately blocks claim and leaves pending physical outcomes visible. Model disclosure requires active destination/classification binding; lowering classification or changing provider requires old authority. Never put raw provider body or secret in diagnostics. Validation validity is exact connection version/account/scopes and expires at configured profile bound. Revision 9: preserve the store-reference challenge/receipt boundary for a signed local GUI helper, including exact account/version/expiry verification, no raw provider key in public operations and authoritative status for lost completion acknowledgement. Coordinate shared receipt-engine changes; do not accept a helper-selected signing key or unaudited orphan ref. Revision 11: browser setup is a trusted hosted-Serenity OAuth challenge. Populate Connection.hosted_memory_grant only from a bearer-authenticated binding read after code exchange; never accept it in a draft/definition. Reconcile lost begin/complete, denied/expired callback and account/project substitution through challenge status and command.get. A valid token without verified issuer/resource/account/project/scopes is not a valid connection.

**`internal/policy`** — Own deterministic authority intersection, standing/exact-review policy and earned autonomy.

Own policy_definitions/restrictions/promotion_rules/qualifications and immutable evaluation evidence links. Policy rules are interpreted bounded declarative conditions only. Supported condition keys: max_cost (Money), required_classification (enum), not_before/expires_at (UTC), required_tool_version (Ref), required_worker_id (ID), required_review (bool); reject unknown executable conditions. Intersect current principal grants, hierarchy ceilings, project/binding, worker/task envelope, restrictions and current resources. Explicit deny wins; missing required condition refuses admission. Default publication/outbound messages/merge/deploy/account substitution/permission expansion require eligible owner review absent narrower prior standing policy. Expansion always under old policy. Promotions bind capability/destination/worker/model/tool/skill versions/window/rule version and independently established evidence; workers cannot approve own evidence, change evaluator/criteria or widen ceiling. Permit automatic narrow grant only under previously approved rule. Relevant changes invalidate affected qualification before new admission; incidents immediately restrict/demote before continued work. Human-required classes persist until owner explicitly changes governing rule. Model summaries and memory judgments are evidence candidates, never policy authority.

**`internal/reviews`** — Own exact reviews, eligibility checks, immutable decisions and delegated review authority.

Own reviews_requests/decisions/delegations. Review preview is the actual immutable Action, not a model summary. Digest binds account/destination/content/media hashes/timing/preconditions/config/tool versions, including repository head and automation consequences. Recheck principal kind/current grant, expiry/version/action digest, optional proposer separation on decide and on effect claim. Agent cannot satisfy human-required review through CLI, claimed boolean or acting as a different profile. Human credentials in a human-authorized process do not prove physical human presence. Delegation cannot broaden eligible class, scope or authority. Changed action creates a new review or invalidates old one; keep history. Manual task acceptance is a separate eligible task operation and remains distinctly labeled. Revision 3 ruling: the eligible reviewer of an exact review-class request is the human principal whose current authority admitted that request; services, workers and agents are never eligible reviewers, and proposer separation stays mandatory for them regardless of any narrower standing policy.

**`internal/accounting`** — Own budget definitions, atomic reservations and exact cost/uncertainty ledgers.

Own accounting_limits/reservations/entries. Reserve installation, ancestor organizations from root down, project, worker and root task in stable order under one caller transaction. Count model/evaluation/retry/delegation/Serenity spend and concurrency under same limits. Exact integer currency micro-units; rational price numerator/denominator and checked ceil for reservations, never floating-point money. Currency mismatches and overflow fail input/prerequisite, missing price refuses paid admission. Proposed defaults do not grant paid spending. Keep spent/reserved/estimated/unknown distinct; unknown physical effects retain reservations. Settlement can release only established unused bound; unknown/advisory external spend cannot be presented as zero or enforced hard cap. Budget expansion stages configuration under current old authority. Root/ancestor caps are shared across children, not copied to each child as an independent allowance.

**`internal/tasks`** — Own durable outcomes, immutable accepted contracts, dependency graph and narrowing delegation.

Own tasks_tasks/dependencies/acceptance/history. States: draft→ready→running→verifying→succeeded or failed; running/ready/verifying may wait with explicit reason and resume to prior admissible state; authorized cancel records intent first, terminal cancelled after stop/fencing disposition. Retry from failed/cancelled creates a new run/attempt under same accepted contract after recovery prerequisites. A worker cannot transition directly to succeeded. Parent success checks explicit required child acceptance, not merely child exit. Prevent dependency cycles. Seal verifier code/version, inputs and expected observations before execution; pending input edits require version and cannot replace accepted verifier in flight. Independent verification runs trusted pinned code through an explicitly qualified verifier runner with artifacts isolated from worker rewriting. V1 built-ins: artifact presence/digest/schema and repository patch check using pinned controlled verification command/profile; arbitrary worker-supplied verifier code is never executed as acceptance authority. Manual acceptance requires eligible configured principal and distinct manual flag. Direct user and chief assignment update same versioned task. Delegation intersects tools/destinations/project data/deadline and shares root budgets; enforce finite depth/count/concurrency/planner/model/time limits. Revision 3: task.start transitions an eligible draft/ready task to ready and enqueues its run in the same transaction, distinct from task.create (draft only) and task.assign (worker/version only, unchanged). _tasks.evidence.record is the sole path that binds trusted verifier evidence to a pinned acceptance digest and named output bindings before any task state depends on it. _tasks.dependencies.wake bounded-scans dependents of a just-completed task and revalidates their eligibility; it never reports success for a dependent whose required child failed.

**`internal/scheduling`** — Own durable schedules, responsibility reasoning cycles, occurrence identities and wake conditions.

Own scheduling_definitions/responsibilities/wakes/occurrences/cycles. Scheduler is driven only by controller; no goroutine scheduler in service constructor or external fleet. Cron syntax is five-field minute/hour/day-of-month/month/day-of-week with IANA time zone; when both day fields restricted, use OR semantics. Repeated local time during DST uses UTC occurrence identity, admit each defined distinct instant once; nonexistent spring-forward local occurrence skipped. Default misfire coalesces one newest eligible missed occurrence within catch_up_seconds; older misses recorded skipped. Empty catch-up window means no catch-up. Occurrence key is schedule ID + pinned template version + UTC instant (or durable event ID for event wake). Recheck pause/cancel/reply condition at transactional admission; authenticated explicit reply events only, no external chat ingestion. Persist task creation, occurrence key and next wake atomically. Responsibilities define signals/triggers, finite per-cycle and aggregate limits, minimum reconsideration interval, pause/escalation conditions and durable outputs even on idle cycles. No arbitrary unbounded polling; controller bounded tick uses injected clock. Pause responsibility independently of unrelated work. Safe mailbox/reply wake admission is deduplicated.

**`internal/messaging`** — Own conversations, durable mailboxes, participant disclosure and meaningful activity projections.

Own messaging_conversations/messages/recipients/receipts/read_markers. Group membership is conversation state, not organization membership, grant or memory binding. Authorize body/attachment disclosure for all recipients before delivery; do not retroactively disclose restricted history on joining. Messages have stable ID, authenticated sender, recipients/scope/task refs. Ack after durable target inbox admission, retry deduplicates ID with content hash; different content under same ID conflicts. Workers ingest at safe step boundary; idle resume uses scheduling/execution ownership, not separate task graph. User requests/chief assignments call versioned task operations with shared task identity. Content is untrusted and cannot change grants or verifier. Persist user messages and actual delivered agent input for reconstructable owned model context. Distinguish meaningful human-facing event from routine reasoning/coordination: quiet internal work does not reorder chats, mark unread or notify. Projection action cards derive committed controller operation/task/review state; text claims are not state. Bootstrap pinned personal-chief conversation. Server scopes all conversation list/hierarchy filters, not only UI. Revision 3: _messaging.ready bounded-scans admitted messages awaiting a durable worker turn, fair and scoped without acknowledgment; _messaging.processed records delivery disposition sharing the same transaction as the execution owner's turn admission/context commit, so a durable link exists even before any reply is produced. conversation.get/.list additionally return the calling principal's own caller_unread_count/caller_last_read_marker; conversation.message.list reads authorized history for one conversation within disclosed membership intervals. Revision 17: _messaging.history is an execution-only bounded query. The worker ID must come from the persisted WorkerTurn and must still be a current conversation participant; query sent plus admitted inbox messages exactly as public history does, preserving membership intervals. Return chronological rows and an explicit complete flag; never disclose pre-join group history or let a client select a worker principal.

**`internal/execution`** — Own runs, executor attempts, leases, hosted loop context, cooperative protocol and verification coordination.

Own execution_runs/attempts/leases/checkpoints/context_lineage/verification_jobs. Run pins effective configuration and task inputs; attempt owns executor/lease/generation/reservation/output disposition. Concurrent claim must choose one current owner, replay lost ack returns same lease. Default heartbeat interval 15s, lease 60s capped by deadline; no revival after expiry/generation change. Stale lease fences Zatiti mutation but does not prove external process death; replacement blocks on explicit conflicting-resource/effect recovery. Hosted loop uses responses adapter only through effects; normalized ResponsesEvidence and ModelOutput arrive from the controller with request_context as an ArtifactLocator of kind artifact, and a staged locator there is an unpublished obligation, never an accepted model step; store all model-visible user messages/tools/results/memory/instructions/agent messages before dispatch. Compaction persists source lineage and actual compacted context artifact. Parse model tool proposals as untrusted typed requests and authorize through effects. Limits apply each step including continuation/evaluation. Cooperative claims return pinned task/context/bindings/capabilities and advisory usage disclaimer, never dispatch credential or owner secrets. Reports bind exact worker/attempt/lease/generation; independent verifier controls task completion. V1 verifier runner executes only accepted pinned verifier profiles in controlled environment, captures observations/artifact hashes, and cannot be replaced by reported worker checks. Cancellation requests owned-loop interrupt and retains unknown physical effects. Own attempt admission counter and release only safe concurrency resources; uncertain cost reservation stays in accounting. Revision 3: additionally own the durable WorkerTurn/ProposalRecord pipeline (execution_turns/execution_proposals) driving _execution.turn.admit -> _execution.work.pending/.claim -> _execution.context.prepare/.commit -> a controller-dispatched effect naming an explicit CallbackRoute (never an undeclared attempt_id folded into adapter parameters) -> _execution.proposal.prepare/.record -> _execution.report -> _execution.verification.pending/.claim/.record. WorkerTurn admission is idempotent on its unique source identity; a message arriving mid-turn is a safe-boundary injection linked to the active turn, never dropped or double-processed. The worker operation executor (contract.WorkerOperator) is implemented in internal/application and injected here only for trusted composition; it resolves the actor from the persisted turn/worker mapping and re-enters ordinary public-operation authorization under that worker's own scope, never controller privilege. Own the shared execution_jobs ledger's LocalJobRunner dispatch (JobWork/JobOutcome in contract); _execution.job.create's optional operation_id links a network-backed job to its originating effects Operation. Revision 17: for a chat turn, resolve its persisted conversation history through _messaging.history using the turn-bound worker ID; merge the currently pending triggering message by stable message ID, deduplicate and order by creation time. If the bounded history reports incomplete, refuse before provider dispatch; ContextArtifact.capture=complete is legal only when all required chat history is present.

**`internal/effects`** — Own immutable actions, logical effects, physical attempts, dispatch claims and reconciliation history.

Own effects_actions/operations/attempts/claims/observations/obligations. Persist exact action before any dispatch. Action preconditions support repository_head, expected_resource_versions, not_before, expires_at and allowed_automation; tool contract fixes allowed keys and parameter schema. Unknown preconditions fail. States prepared→awaiting_review/ready/denied; ready→executing after claimed admitted attempt; executing→succeeded/failed/awaiting_confirmation/outcome_unknown. Unsent expired/cancelled/denied allowed only if no earlier attempt can still act. Known provider acceptance is awaiting_confirmation, not success. Admit and claim each recheck relevant current policy and exact review. Current authorization plus budget reservation/attempt/intent/evidence is one transaction. Controller owns actual Invoke and record transaction; service never does network. Idempotency qualifications bind equivalent request/account/destination and real provider retention window. Retry is separate physical attempt with current checks, never hidden adapter retry. Unknown older attempt survives newer failure. Reconciliation bounded read needs own authorization/attempt/cost; authoritative no-effect evidence differs from eventual-consistency not-found. Compensation/replacement new linked operation with independent review. Late contradictory evidence appends explicit correction/dispute; immutable observations never rewritten. Expose unknown status honestly to UI/CLI/MCP/backup. Revision 3: _effects.prepare accepts an optional callback_route (CallbackRoute: worker_turn/job/memory/skill/connection plus the relevant id) persisted alongside the immutable action and returned unmodified at claim in Dispatch.callback_route; adapters never see it. This is the sole routing mechanism back to the caller that prepared the effect -- never an attempt_id folded into strict adapter parameters. _effects.record accepts an optional current_generation to resolve a stray attempt across a controller-generation change (not_sent if never actually claimed under its recorded generation, outcome_unknown if claimed but unconfirmed). New _effects.reconciliation.prepare/.record create a separately admitted, separately authorized and accounted bounded reconciliation read distinct from the original write; the observation merges into the original operation's uncertainty and never overwrites or replays the original action. Revision 15: profile qualification is a separately admitted external_read model effect with its own exact candidate digest and explicit maximum probe cost. It receives the normal destination/classification/current-authority checks and token/cost reservation. Its specialized dispatch is allowed to omit prior capability_evidence only when bound to the persisted qualification job and allowlisted probe action; never broaden this exception to ordinary model_step. One claim yields one physical call; lost acknowledgement after possible send remains outcome_unknown with no retry. Revision 16: _effects.prepare accepts qualification_id only from Configuration. Resolve the candidate through the private configuration seam, check it against action connection/destination/cost and the model-responses tool, and persist that exact evidence-free adapter profile before admission. No public operation may inject this field or use it for model_step.

**`internal/memory`** — Own scoped memory bindings, governed Serenity jobs and promotion/retraction lineage.

Own memory_brains/bindings/jobs/intents/promotions/reconciliation, not canonical Serenity claims store. Distinct brain for each worker/org and installation, including separate personal-chief/root-org/install brain. Private restricted project knowledge stays in narrower bound brain or governed artifact, never leaked into broadly readable org brain. Select authorized brains before recall/model composition; current scope/grants/bindings and revocation matter at retrieval. Parentage/group membership no implicit read. Recall is potentially paid disclosure: effect admission/reservations govern recall/composition/embedding/extraction/curation; required unenforceable bounds make mode unavailable or explicitly advisory only where policy permits. Store actual selected context artifact retaining source/confidence/version/freshness. Cross-brain reads are not atomic snapshot; minimum unavailable freshness waits/refuses. Chief automatic curation stays within standing source disclosure and destination curate/write authority, budgets and evidence. Promotion creates new claim linked source brain/claim version/evidence/curator/redaction; copied statements not independent corroboration. Corrections/retractions create durable downstream obligations. Immediate revocation excludes future retrieval but cannot erase past disclosures/Git/backups/history. Persist writer intent and adapter command identity BEFORE dispatch to sole writer per brain. Normalized SerenityEvidence arrives from the controller with physical_call.request_context as an ArtifactLocator of kind artifact; a staged locator there is an unpublished obligation, never accepted as success. Lost ack reconciles qualified writer disposition, never blind repeat. Memory.inspect must be an authorized local read-facade query with no external paid work; if not available return prerequisite_missing directing caller to recall job. Backup manifests include brain revisions and key prerequisites; restore paused pending reconciliation. Revision 11: the personal chief may bind to an already populated hosted Serenity brain under one verified grant. Keep separate hosted projects for narrower private worker/organization brains. Resolve local UUID to exact external project before dispatch; no inherited read across bindings. Backup pins the immutable hosted revision/export and paused restore reconciles outstanding writes.

**`internal/artifacts`** — Own immutable artifact metadata, resumable bounded uploads and integrity-visible byte access.

Own artifacts_metadata/uploads/chunks/pins/faults. BlobStore owns bytes/encryption and filesystem operations. Use local IO prepare/perform/finish interface to stream/stage/hash/publish outside Unit; publish file before committing metadata. Upload begin binds caller/scope/expected size/hash/classification/media type. Chunk requires exact contiguous offset or identical existing chunk replay, validates decoded <=1 MiB and chunk digest, different replay conflicts. Finish checks total bytes/hash, publishes CAS and then metadata/event atomically. Crash after file publish creates reclaimable orphan; after metadata but missing bytes yields visible artifact_fault and blocks success. Never accept server file paths. Range reads authorize metadata/classification then verify integrity before bounded disclosure; returned base64 reflects actual bytes. Sensitive bytes encrypted with external key; metadata hashes not proof of external custody. Retention pins unresolved work/context/verifier/backup references; staging GC only unreferenced expired items. Disk pressure pauses producing work, never erases uncertainty.

**`internal/evidence`** — Own durable command replay, authorized event reads and receipts projected from actual evidence.

Own evidence_commands/receipts/retention_pins; storage owns append-only transactional event/outbox records. Event/command outputs must authorize scope/principal and redact before persistence where possible. Keys bind principal/op/version/canonical request hash, same payload returns original complete/accepted/failed disposition, different content conflicts. Reserve identity and successful state in one writer transaction. Application records rejected mutation disposition separately after rollback with concurrency-safe same-key behavior. Retain keys >=30 days AND as long as any unresolved obligation depends on them. Event cursor scopes filters/principal and snapshot; authenticated opaque token expiry explicit, new snapshot required after retention gap. Storage.Events is trusted raw feed, not a bypass endpoint. Receipts link immutable decisions/provider observations/artifact digests, not worker assertion or log text. Arbitrary secret recognition/infallible history is not claimed; host/DB admin outside threat model. No pruning unresolved evidence to appear healthy.

**`internal/installation`** — Own bootstrap, installation restriction/maintenance state, health, encrypted backup and paused restore jobs.

Own installation_state/jobs/manifests/recovery_obligations. Initialize only local OS-authorized uninitialized destination under exclusive lock. Trusted helper creates owner secret outside transaction, then one bootstrap transaction initializes identity + root organization/chief + distinct memory brains + pinned conversation and evidence. Handle crash between helper and transaction with opaque pending bootstrap intent and recover/cleanup without exporting token; refuse reinitialization. Init selects secure store and creates metadata only, no paid model until configured. Bootstrap MCP mode ends after success and cannot become admin session. Maintenance/pause is immediate acknowledged restriction; drains/fences owned work, preserve unknown effects. Backup IO obtains SQLite consistent backup plus pinned artifact manifest/brain revisions at quiesced boundary, encrypts and verifies whole bundle before completed. The consistent backup bytes come ONLY from the contract.DatabaseBackup capability supplied by entrypoint assembly: expose type Option func(*Service); WithDatabaseBackup(contract.DatabaseBackup) Option; New(contract.Dependencies, ...Option) (*Service,error). This package receives no contract.Database, Reader or file path and must not type-assert the capability to a wider interface. Call Backup only in LocalIO.Perform, never inside a Unit, streaming through a hashing/counting writer into Blobs.Stage so database_digest and database_size describe exactly the staged bytes; the same call before a restore produces RecoveryOverlay.source_database_digest. Without the option, installation.backup and installation.restore return prerequisite_missing naming the database backup capability and never fabricate a digest; init, maintenance, health and doctor work without it, and doctor reports the missing capability. Backups use schema zatiti.backup/v1: installation_id, generation, database_digest, artifact manifest entries, brain revisions, retained command/revocation obligations and opaque key prerequisites. Never include decrypting master keys in same bundle. Restore uploaded reference only, maintenance exclusive ownership, validate integrity/version/keys, starts paused. Preserve both backup and later durable revocation/command/claimed-effect obligations across rewind: before restore export an encrypted current recovery overlay, merge monotonically after restore; fail closed on unresolved conflicts and keep overlay. Reconcile pending effects/memory writes before resume; a database rewind cannot undo providers. Doctor names missing provider/price/profile/Serenity/platform limitations without secrets. Local IO executor handles backup/helper work; no IO in Unit. Revision 3 adds a narrow entrypoint-supplied SnapshotInventory/RestoreCoordinator capability (contract), separate from DatabaseBackup and supplied only to this package the same way: Inventory returns the exact BackupManifest; Prepare validates the source bundle and stages a RecoveryOverlay without a destructive action; Commit atomically switches the database/blobs under exclusive maintenance ownership after the current monotonic overlay (revocations, cancellations, consumed claims, provider dedup keys, unresolved effects/costs, retained evidence) has been captured. Restore starts paused and requires an explicit authorized resume that rechecks prerequisites again; never resurrect a revoked credential, resend a consumed dispatch or erase a liability absent from the older snapshot. Public installation.verifier.list enumerates installed trusted verifier profiles (secret-free) so a task's acceptance contract can name one.

**`internal/registry`** — Own typed operation registration, collision checks, discovery, schema/OpenAPI generation and parity enumeration.

Expose New([]contract.Module) (*Registry,error), Lookup(string,int64) (contract.Descriptor,contract.Handler,error), Public() []contract.Descriptor, OpenAPI() ([]byte,error), and Bind generic helper exactly as shared contract. Implement capabilities as registry-owned Module; dependency-free descriptor discovery avoids recursive self-registration. Freeze public IDs/CLI/MCP names and schemas from embedded catalog. Validate unique IDs/version, owner, exact DTO schemas, dot/underscore name collisions, complete mappings, descriptor mode and submission semantics. Internal descriptors never appear in Public/OpenAPI/CLI/MCP or accepted public routing. OpenAPI 3.1 emits local schemas, error/result envelopes, request bodies and explicit accepted references. Generated client-facing catalog is derived from runtime typed registry, never another behavior authority. Baseline functionality cannot depend on optional MCP resources/prompts.

**`internal/application`** — Own authenticated operation execution, transaction composition, internal port allowlists and durable submission replay.

Expose New(contract.Database,*registry.Registry,contract.Authenticator,contract.Clock,contract.IDSource) (*Application,error); Invoke(context.Context,contract.Actor,string,contract.Request) (contract.Result,error); Internal(context.Context,contract.Actor,contract.Scope,contract.Invocation) (contract.Payload,error); Authenticate(context.Context,[]byte) (contract.Actor,error); AuthenticateCertificate(context.Context,contract.Digest) (contract.Actor,error); Ports() contract.Ports. Application consumes only registry/contract, never imports domain packages. Expose NewPorts() *PortRouter, (*PortRouter).For(string) contract.Ports, and Bind(*Application) error for the exact two-phase assembly specified in common contract. Composition registers modules and injects app Ports using a constructor-safe late-bound dispatcher; no service calls until assembly complete. Public Invoke derives Unit scope from validated input plus referenced resource, revalidates authenticated actor, rejects internal operation. Gate _policy.check for every public capability; exceptions only bootstrap/capabilities as explicitly specified. Create mutation command identity/replay before stale checks; invoke handler in same ordered transaction; wrap result. Internal method callable only trusted controller scope, checks service principal and allowed entrypoints; ordinary domain Ports calls retain same actor/Unit and caller stack. Enforce catalog callers/visibility/mode, no recursive operation loop, no impersonation. Separate local IO prepare/perform/finish paths for explicitly registered IO modules; repeat authorization and version check at final metadata publication/disclosure. An accepted external job is not dispatched in request transaction. Record known refusal after rollback without losing dedupe concurrency. Bootstrap invokes shared installation initializer with special local capability granted by owner lock only.

**`internal/controller`** — Own one controller lifetime, adapter dispatch, durable background work and recovery coordination.

Expose Config{StateDir string; TickInterval time.Duration; MaxDispatch int}; New(Config,*application.Application,contract.Database,contract.Ownership,map[string]contract.Adapter,contract.Clock) (*Controller,error); Run(context.Context) error; Stop(context.Context) error. Entrypoint startup holder acquires platform lock, migrates DB and advances generation before constructing controller/listener; controller receives held Ownership, does not lock or advance twice, and stops admission on Ownership.Lost. Tick default 1s and max batch 100, bounded by installation concurrency; no scheduler in MCP/service New, and none in the Flutter desktop client. Resolve durable due wakes and pending intents, admit then claim via app.Internal, call exactly one adapter outside tx, record observation. Persist ambiguity when process dies after claim; restart fences old generation and never resends claimed effects blindly. Owned model/memory/probe outcomes delivered to corresponding internal record/observation methods transactionally after effect record using durable deduplicated outbox. Worker loop context bytes staged and published before context pin and effect intent. After recording a raw adapter observation, publish every StagedOutput through the artifacts owner, including the staged request context named by physical_call.request_context (and ModelOutput.request_context), for every disposition including not_sent and unknown; replace each staged ArtifactLocator with kind artifact and the published ArtifactRef in the normalized evidence delivered to owners, reject an observation whose staged locator matches no StagedOutput or more than one, and never rewrite the raw recorded observation. Trusted verifier runner and local IO background jobs execute outside tx with own pinned accepted profile; record results through task/execution owner. Loss of installation lock/ownership immediately stops admission; graceful shutdown fences or records unresolved work, never invents provider cancellation. Run remains active after desktop disconnect. The controller never hands its contract.Database, or any part of it, to a module: installation's consistent-backup capability is bound by entrypoint assembly before the controller exists, so executing an installation.backup/restore job is only invoking installation's LocalIO plan. A plan that reports prerequisite_missing for the database backup capability is recorded as a failed job with that named prerequisite, never retried into success or substituted by a controller-side file copy. Secret helper/Serenity process lifecycle belongs controller installation packaging, one writer/brain; refuse unsupported version/capability. Revision 15: drive qualification jobs through the normal effects claim/dispatch/record path, stage/publish the exact provider request/response evidence through artifacts, and finish only the originating job after matching operation, connection version, profile digest and candidate. Preserve unknown without resend and never let a stale callback qualify changed settings. Revision 16: route a linked configuration/execution_profile.qualify job by its exact effects operation_id; publish staged evidence, then in one write Unit record the configuration qualification result and the originating execution job result. Replay of a committed callback returns the same result; stale or unknown outcomes never qualify.

**`internal/server`** — Own private socket HTTP/JSON and explicit remote-desktop mutual TLS transport.

Expose Config{SocketPath string; RemoteAddress string; TLSConfig *tls.Config; MaxBodyBytes int64}; New(Config,*application.Application) (*Server,error); Serve(context.Context) error; Close(context.Context) error. net/http over private Unix socket, no unauthenticated public bind. Direct clients are internal/client (Go) and the Flutter desktop at apps/desktop (Dart); both receive identical envelopes, faults and limits, and nothing is relaxed for the desktop. Selected client credential arrives in Authorization header from secure client storage, never operation input/logs; TLS certificate maps to provisioned principal and still checks current app authority. Versioned POST operation endpoint only; public descriptor allowlist. Request limits/timeouts, strict content type/envelope, bounded responses, request cancellation never assumes accepted command rollback. Authenticate before data lookup. Domain faults encoded in envelope with shared HTTP mapping; protocol malformed bodies mapped invalid_input. No scheduler/DB raw handler, no alternate restore/admin endpoint. Local-only bootstrap route guarded by initializer lock/state; remote cannot bootstrap.

**`internal/client`** — Own shared controller client, secure credential plumbing, reconnect and explicit submission-key retry.

Expose Config{SocketPath string; RemoteURL string; TLSConfig *tls.Config; Timeout time.Duration}; New(Config,contract.CredentialSource) (*Client,error); (*Client).Call(context.Context,string,contract.Request) (contract.Result,error), implementing contract.Operator. Local Unix HTTP transport; explicit remote TLS only where configured. Go callers (CLI, MCP, qualification drivers) use this package; the Flutter desktop at apps/desktop cannot import it and reimplements these exact semantics in Dart against the same wire contract. CredentialSource provides header bytes securely per request, never JSON/tool arguments. Strict envelope validation and bounded body reads. Never replace a mutation key after timeout. Auto retries only safe transport connection establishment before any request bytes, or explicit identical submission with same key; unknown ack resolved command.get. Cursor expiry surfaces snapshot_required so caller refreshes snapshot before replay; never fill gap silently. No server file opens, scheduler, model defaults or hidden paid fallback. Cancellation of local wait is not cancellation of accepted command.

**`internal/cli`** — Own Cobra command generation, structured input, deterministic JSON output and process exit mapping.

Expose IO{In io.Reader; Out io.Writer; Err io.Writer}; New(contract.Operator,[]contract.Descriptor,IO) (*cobra.Command,error); Execute(context.Context,[]string,contract.Operator,[]contract.Descriptor,IO) int. Generate all public product commands from descriptor mappings. --input @file / --input - / inline JSON read on client side; all convenience flags fill same schema. --json one complete envelope to stdout, diagnostics stderr; no TTY requirement/silent input prompts. Missing fields fail invalid_input. capabilities shortcut explicit. Transport mechanics serve/mcp serve/help/completion belong cmd assembly and cannot register shadow product operations. Bootstrap uses same initializer via local client mode; credential profile is startup configuration inaccessible in operation arguments. Read artifact bytes into chosen client path only; never send a server path. Preserve command IDs, accepted job refs, version/key/error/cursor semantics. Human rendering derives same result and honest unknown/manual/advisory labels.

**`internal/mcp`** — Own stdio MCP adapter over the common authenticated controller client.

Expose Serve(context.Context,io.Reader,io.Writer,io.Writer,contract.Operator,[]contract.Descriptor) error. Pin official SDK and supported protocol during foundation qualification. stdout only MCP frames, diagnostics stderr. Register each public descriptor as actual typed tool, no shell/CLI wrapper. Common request schema including submission_key is tool input; descriptor data schema wraps common result for output. structuredContent and text JSON equivalent; domain failed => isError, malformed protocol => protocol error. Tool args cannot pick credential profile. Missing controller named controller_unavailable, never start another scheduler. Baseline only initialize/tools/list/tools/call and Zatiti polling; optional sampling/elicitation/resources/prompts/task extensions disabled during qualification. Bootstrap --bootstrap is separate one-time local initializer session, exits after success, cannot become privileged ordinary session. No remote HTTP MCP in v1.

**`internal/adapters/responses`** — Qualified hosted Responses model adapter.

Adapter name responses; profile schema zatiti.responses/v1 has endpoint, model, connection_id, input/output token bounds, max_response_bytes, timeout_seconds, currency, input/output rational rates, capability evidence artifact. Endpoint/provider/model are installation inputs, no default account/model/price. Pin documented Responses wire fields during qualification and preserve full model-visible request artifact. Input Action.parameters includes context_artifact, max_output_tokens, tool_contract_versions; output Observation.evidence includes response_id, output artifact refs, typed tool proposals and finish reason. Never execute model tool proposals in adapter. Enforce explicit disclosure destination/classification and bounded token charges; refuse hard cap if selected API cannot bound required spend. One physical HTTP invocation per Invoke, no mutation retry. Timeout after bytes sent => unknown; provider response acceptance not invented success. Sanitize provider bodies/errors; usage exact observed tokens/prices or unknown. Reconciliation only documented authoritative lookup under qualified retention, otherwise preserve unknown. No hidden provider/model fallback. Revision 3 freezes ResponsesParameters/ResponsesEvidence as a kind-discriminated oneOf: prepare_session creates the provider conversation and returns session_handle with no model-visible content and no context_artifact; model_step names that persisted session_handle and sends context_artifact/max_output_tokens/tool_contract_versions. Each Invoke performs exactly one of the two, never both; a prepare_session whose response is lost stays unknown and is never retried into a second session, and a model_step timeout after bytes were sent is outcome_unknown with no automatic fresh call. Revision 15: support the fixed qualification_probe action only for an effects operation carrying the controller-persisted qualification-job route and a strict evidence-free ResponsesProfileDraft. The probe has a fixed non-sensitive prompt, bounded input/output/response bytes and one physical request; it cannot invoke tools, continue, follow redirects or retry. Emit only observed protocol/model/usage evidence; do not assert capabilities not exercised or documented. Ordinary prepare_session/model_step still require a complete evidence-bound profile.

**`internal/adapters/github`** — Qualified GitHub repository artifact/publication adapter.

Adapter name github; profile schema zatiti.github/v1 has api_base, allowed_repositories, allowed_actions, max_response_bytes, timeout_seconds, idempotency_profile and automation_constraints. Action.parameters discriminated kind read_repository/create_branch/push_commit/open_pull_request/merge_pull_request; exact repository owner/name, branch/head SHA, base SHA, patch/content artifact hashes, PR title/body artifact and relevant workflow/automation bounds. Restrict v1 publication to qualified forms, unsupported action named capability_unsupported. Review binds exact repo/head/content/timing/account and downstream automation effects; opening PR is consequential. Fetch/check current preconditions immediately before governed call where contract supports, but no unrecorded additional HTTP calls: preflight is its own admitted read. No automatic hidden write retry. Provider accepted/confirmed/unknown distinguished; GitHub eventual not-found cannot prove nonexecution. Repository outputs are governed immutable artifacts, never unbounded controller working-directory shell execution. HTTP redirects cannot widen host/account scope.

**`internal/adapters/httpread`** — Qualified bounded public HTTP reads for research.

Adapter name httpread; profile schema zatiti.httpread/v1 has allowed_origins, max_bytes, timeout_seconds, max_redirects, allowed_media_types. Action.parameters url, method fixed GET, permitted headers excluding raw secret input, expected_media_type. Current authorization/classification/disclosure and cost bound apply even to reads. Enforce response size/time bounds before consuming unlimited bytes, restrict redirect origins and resolve destination at each hop. Refuse local/private/link-local/metadata addresses unless separately explicit installation-authorized destination binding; prevent DNS rebinding by binding validated dial addresses. Each actual physical request/redirect is an accounted effect attempt; simplest v1 qualified profile sets max_redirects=0 and returns prerequisite for an explicit redirected read. Record requested/resolved URL, status, bounded content digest/artifact and freshness for cited brief. No arbitrary shell/browser/script execution.

**`internal/adapters/serenity`** — Qualified public Serenity protocol/read-facade adapter and writer capability report.

Adapter name serenity; profile schema zatiti.serenity/v1 has exact version/commit, public endpoint/brain root mapping, writer ownership, supported operations, cost/disclosure enforcement profile, command status lookup semantics, freshness/index capability, timeout_seconds, max_bytes and backup revision protocol. During foundation integration inspect public upstream API and pin exact source/protocol; never invent a public method from name or import internal packages. Adapter action kind recall/remember/inspect/promote/retract/export_revision, brain_id and stable adapter_command_id plus bounded payload. Brain selected by memory owner authorization, adapter cannot widen query. Canonical writes only one writer per brain; exported Go facade only for compatible reads. Recall may call models and incur charges, so required bound/disclosure enforcement must be qualified before enabling. If actual API cannot provide safe command lookup after lost ack, retain unknown and require explicit reconciliation; do not claim idempotency. Preserve provenance/source/version/freshness in observations. Backup pins real brain revisions, handles Git/history and keys, restore paused pending writer/promotion obligations. Report unsupported guarantees honestly and gate release until required first-release modes qualified. Revision 11: hosted Streamable HTTP MCP is the Mac primary. Map local UUID brains to verified hosted alphanumeric project IDs via the connection grant, never parse one as the other. Account the MCP handshake separately. Require public authenticated binding identity, authoritative command status, full claim/lineage/freshness and immutable revision/export evidence, enforced per-call cost/disclosure and verifiable build capabilities before advertising a supported operation. A hosted quota alone is not a hard cost bound; keep unsupported actions fail-closed.

**`packaging`** — Own release manifests, service launchers, secure helper and Serenity distribution lifecycle.

This Go package and supporting templates own distribution assembly and lifecycle; production imports only the standard library. macOS LaunchAgent and Linux user systemd unit keep controller alive independently of desktop. Package binaries plus pinned Serenity runtime/read facade as qualified; one writer owner per brain and one controller state lock. Build the Flutter desktop from apps/desktop once per target platform with the pinned Flutter SDK (flutter build macos / flutter build linux, release mode) and package the resulting application bundle separately from the Go controller binary; this root owns the bundle/installer assembly and launcher metadata, not the application source. No Go desktop binary exists. Artifact manifest includes version/checksum/licenses/SBOM, supported protocol/profiles, the Flutter/Dart SDK and plugin versions with their license notices, and required native runtime dependencies of the Flutter Linux runner (GTK and the Secret Service client library) and macOS runner. The desktop bundle carries no controller state, database driver or credentials. Secret/key provisioning uses trusted local OS helper, never flags/chat/environment inherited by worker. Install/uninstall preserve state unless explicit operator removal requested; no invented working install command before built artifacts tested. Avoid signing/notarization/publishing claims without actual evidence. Root release CI is separate workflow owner. Backup/restoration key prerequisites documented without private paths or real secrets. Revision 7: own the signed bounded Mac delivery record and exact six-asset mapping around the existing staged descriptor; offline fixtures never imply a downloadable signed/notarized installer or a published command. Revision 8: own the protected atomic Mac accepted-release fence and separate bootstrap lock, with audited same-release rerun and install-before-fence recovery; package activation remains unavailable without its separately frozen verifier. Revision 9: produce one data-only per-user signed/notarized pkg per Mac architecture, with exact owner-only three-file inbox and acyclic zatiti.mac_pkg_binding/v1. Inspect actual bounded package payload and reject scripts, extra components and unsafe paths before fixed system-installer invocation; after staging, re-verify bytes, require an injected MacMasterKeyProvisioner before Apply (never import platform here), audit and advance rev8 fence. Add one separately signed AppKit credential_helper executable at bin/zatiti-credential-helper to the Mac controller manifest/tree, with its architecture/signature checked; desktop bundle remains helper-free. Own a universal signed/notarized ZatitiBootstrap.app wrapper around RunMacBootstrap plus a small generated script pinned by literal hash in the release one-line command; script pins bootstrap ZIP hash, checks exact signing/notary identity and uses no curl-pipe-to-shell. No production activation through injected fake verifier/runner or unqualified Apple behavior. Revision 10: RunMacBootstrap requires nonnil production installed-inbox verifier, MacMasterKeyProvisioner and activator/auditor in addition to the package verifier/installer. Under one bootstrap lock: verify package bytes and Apple trust, install fixed per-user pkg, audit exact installed inbox, provision fixed default master key, Apply, audit both active trees/helper/launcher, then advance fence. Audit existing active release before same-sequence return or install-before-fence recovery; a pkg receipt or inert inbox is insufficient. Preserve fail-closed behavior until signed native qualification. Revision 11: Mac hosted mode installs controller, desktop and signed credential helper only. Do not require or launch a bundled Serenity runtime or local read facade in manifests, service plans or active-tree audit. Preserve fixed Keychain master selector and all package trust/activation checks.

## Shared foundation contract

# Frozen implementation contract, revision 17

These decisions complete the product specification and bind every scope. Report contradictions with an affected-dependency list and proposed coordinated revision; do not change another owner's interface locally.

Revision 13 permits a Responses v2 provider-conversation evidence record to omit `session_handle` when its physical call was not authoritatively successful. A confirmed prepare-session still requires a nonempty handle; stateless evidence still forbids it. This preserves honest unknown/failure outcomes without inventing a provider session identifier. Execution persists the model-step index alongside each effects operation reference and accepts a callback only when that exact reference, route step, current turn step and `model_pending` state agree. Chat observations use the existing controller-only `_execution.turn.observation` operation and never fabricate a task or Attempt.

Revision 14 carries the transaction-pinned, secret-free context recipe in the internal-only ContextPlan so the trusted ContextPerformer can rebuild the exact context outside a Unit without opening owner tables or inventing artifact identities. The controller stages and publishes the bytes through BlobStore and `_artifacts.publish`; execution alone commits the returned owner-minted artifact after rechecking plan generation, authority and pinned references. The recipe is never a public client field or model-callable input.

Revision 15 adds `execution_profile.qualify` as the only path from a client-authored provider-profile draft to executable capability evidence. The strict `ExecutionProfileCandidate`/`ResponsesProfileDraft` schemas contain all selected provider, model, route, price and resource bounds but have no `capability_evidence` field. The operation creates one durable job and one separately admitted, explicitly cost-bounded qualification effect bound to the exact active connection version, candidate profile digest, destination, route and requested capability set. The qualification probe uses fixed non-sensitive input, one physical provider request, the normal credential resolver, current principal/scope/classification/disclosure checks, current cost reservation and the exact provider adapter. No fallback, retry, redirect, SDK retry or hidden auxiliary call is permitted. Before dispatch, persist the exact bounded request context through the ordinary artifact path. On authoritative response, the controller records the physical-call evidence and publishes a qualification artifact; only the trusted completion writer can construct a `QualifiedExecutionProfile` and its evidence bound to the canonical candidate digest. Provider refusal is a failed job. Lost acknowledgement after request bytes may have been sent is `outcome_unknown`, remains visible on the same job and cannot be silently resent or turned into a qualified profile. A caller can start a fresh qualification only after authoritative non-execution of the prior probe. Completion does not create or activate an execution profile: Desktop consumes the trusted result through the existing `execution_profile.create` → plan → explicit apply path. The existing context preparation/publication/commit generation and authority fences remain unchanged.

Revision 16 makes the qualification candidate resolution private and effect-bound. `_configuration.execution_profile.qualification.resolve` returns only the exact pending candidate and canonical digest to Effects. `_effects.prepare` may name that qualification ID only from the configuration owner; Effects verifies its connection, endpoint, model, price and requested bounds against the immutable action, then persists the candidate profile on the effect. Ordinary public effects still require an exact already-qualified execution profile, and cannot set the qualification ID or inject `Dispatch.adapter_profile`. The durable job links to the one effect operation so the controller can complete that same job from the exact physical observation.

Revision 11 selects **hosted Serenity as the primary Mac memory service**. The user's existing hosted personal brain is the default personal-chief brain, including when another client already uses it. Zatiti does not create or import a duplicate personal brain during setup. Serenity remains the canonical memory writer; Zatiti retains local execution, authorization, accounting, conversation and recovery state. Separate restricted worker or project brains, when required by the existing isolation contract, are separate projects within the same hosted Serenity account and require explicit grants. The free tier may be offered, but no paid entitlement, quota, extra brain, or successful memory call is assumed from sign-in alone. The local Serenity distribution path is optional future/self-hosted packaging; the Mac release descriptor, controller manifest, bootstrap, installer and LaunchAgent do not require or start a bundled Serenity binary or local read facade for the hosted mode. Preserve the rev10 installer and trust chain for Zatiti's controller, desktop and credential helper.

**Trusted browser setup.** `connection.setup.begin(method=browser)` is an intent boundary, not a preassembled URL from user-provided metadata. A signed installed helper owns exact OAuth protected-resource and authorization-server discovery from the fixed `https://serenity.sire.run/mcp` resource, dynamic public-client registration, an ephemeral numeric-loopback callback, S256 PKCE, state, nonce, deadline, system-browser launch, exact callback validation, code exchange and rotating token custody in the existing installation-local Keychain-backed SecretStore. Discovery endpoints and redirects must remain on the configured Serenity origin except the registered exact loopback callback; TLS, byte/time bounds and issuer/resource matching fail closed. No authorization code, verifier, access/refresh token or raw credential enters Dart, a public operation, argv, logs, model context or an environment variable. `connection.setup.status`, `command.get`, the durable challenge and a protected keyed helper intent reconcile browser denial, callback loss, token-response ambiguity, refresh loss, crash and retry without silently creating a second grant or replacing a different account. The helper returns only a redacted status. A revoked, expired or mismatched grant makes the connection unavailable and offers a fresh sign-in, never a plaintext token fallback.

**Verified brain binding.** OAuth consent selects exactly one existing hosted project/brain and read or read/write scope. The helper must call a public bearer-protected hosted binding endpoint after token exchange; that endpoint must return the issuing resource, stable account ID, selected hosted project ID, effective scopes, grant identity and current project state for this exact token. A browser callback or token response alone is insufficient to assert those values. `Connection.hosted_memory_grant` is server-observed, nonsecret metadata populated only by trusted setup/validation, excluded from user-authored connection definitions and model-supplied fields. `zatiti.serenity/v2` adds `SerenityHostedBrainMapping` with local `brain_id`, exact `hosted_project_id`, verified `connection_id`, endpoint and classification; the adapter checks it against the current connection grant. A local Zatiti UUID brain maps explicitly to one verified hosted project ID and one connection/grant; the hosted alphanumeric ID is never parsed as a UUID. The personal-chief mapping may target the user's already populated hosted brain. The account/project choice is displayed before activation; switching either requires a new explicit binding and current authority. No organization/worker automatically inherits the personal brain. A current connection/grant check precedes every memory dispatch, and revocation restricts use immediately.

**Hosted adapter and release gate.** The adapter uses the public hosted MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint, performs its session handshake as separately identified, bounded and accounted transport work, and never claims one MCP tool call is a sessionless physical request. It pins a verifiable server build/capability statement and fail-closes on missing or changed semantics. Serenity must expose public, authenticated, brain-scoped capabilities sufficient for the existing full `recall`, `remember`, `inspect`, `promote`, `retract`, `export_revision`, authoritative command-status, freshness, source/lineage, cost and disclosure guarantees; a hosted quota is not a Zatiti per-call hard spend bound. Zatiti's backup must pin and verify an immutable hosted brain revision and export/recovery path; an empty brain list or a web dashboard is not backup evidence. Until those upstream surfaces are implemented and qualified, the adapter stays unavailable and the Mac install-to-first-chat release remains blocked. Native Intel and Apple Silicon qualification must sign in through the real browser flow, verify the selected pre-existing brain identity and scoped read/write, perform and read back a real memory effect plus a real provider reply on the same clean-host release chain, and prove revocation/reconnect and backup revision behavior. This changes `internal/connections`, `internal/platform`, `internal/adapters/serenity`, `internal/memory`, `cmd/zatiti`, `apps/desktop`, `packaging`, CI and qualification; no synthetic OAuth fixture is live-service evidence.

Revision 10 coordinates the **post-package activation seam and linked clean-host evidence**. Revision 9's signed package, Keychain, helper and full Serenity gates remain unchanged. It adds no public operation or delivery field. A compiled binary, unsigned candidate, inert package inbox, independent case passes, or provider response without the same-host installation chain cannot establish a Mac install-to-first-chat release.

**Bootstrap phase contract.** `packaging.RunMacBootstrap` retains the signed delivery, package verifier, native architecture detector and protected watermark lock. Its production input additionally requires the current user's exact `Home` and fixed default Mac `StateDir`, a nonnil `MacInstalledInboxVerifier.VerifyInstalled(ctx, home, release, plan, binding) (MacStagedAssets, error)`, `MacMasterKeyProvisioner.Provision(ctx, stateDir) error`, and `MacReleaseActivator` with `Activate(ctx, release, plan, verifiedInbox) error` and `Audit(ctx, release, plan) (bool, error)`. These are packaging-owned interfaces; `packaging` remains standard-library-only. The entrypoint at `cmd/zatiti` is explicitly allowed to import `packaging` and injects `platform.ProvisionMacMasterKey` as the provisioner. `Home` and `StateDir` are checked against the current login user's real home and `$HOME/Library/Application Support/zatiti`; a caller cannot choose another package target or master-key account. The production package verifier proves final SHA, actual bounded package payload/BOM/Distribution/PackageInfo, out-of-band Developer ID Installer Team ID/certificate, stapled notary ticket and Gatekeeper install assessment before the fixed system-installer call. Only after installer success does `VerifyInstalled` re-open the exact three owner-only inbox files, compare binding and archive bytes against the signed plan, and return those verified archive paths. Under the same bootstrap lock, `Provision` then establishes the retained master item before `Activate` builds the ordinary `Plan` from the two verified archives and calls `Apply`. `Audit` checks both active signed trees, helper and fixed LaunchAgent against the descriptor before the accepted watermark advances. `MacInstallRunner.Installed` or a package receipt cannot substitute for `Audit`; an inert inbox is not an active release. On same-sequence rerun and after a crash between `Apply` and fence publication, re-provision without rotation, audit the exact active release and only then return or advance the fence. A different accepted digest, partial tree, uncertain audit or absent production capability fails closed. Existing injected-fake tests establish orchestration only; a production bootstrap cannot use a fake verifier/runner. This revision affects `packaging`, `cmd/zatiti`, `internal/platform`, `tests/integration`, `tests/qualification` and CI.

**Helper recovery record.** The owner-only bounded per-connection intent may retain the nonsecret installation/connection/challenge IDs, expected versions and expiry, account identity, a stable credential name, the opaque store reference and one submission key for each intended begin/complete call. It records an exact canonical request digest (or the bounded exact request bytes) before dispatch so a retry cannot silently change the receipt, expected version or submission key. The reader validates phase-dependent required fields and refuses malformed or partial records; no provider key, HMAC key or owner Authorization header enters the intent. This replaces revision 9's overly narrow phrase that listed only the reference and IDs; it does not authorize extra public fields. Terminal and AppKit entrypoints use the same recovery rule. This affects `cmd/zatiti`, `internal/connections` and qualification crash fixtures.

**Linked native release proof.** `QUALIFICATION.macos_install_to_first_chat` is one named live case per native architecture on a clean account without developer tools. Its redacted `zatiti.ci.mac_release_host/v1` evidence binds a unique host-run ID and OS build, exact signed release version/sequence, descriptor/delivery/script/universal-bootstrap hashes, out-of-band signer Team ID and certificate hash, and that architecture's installer/controller/desktop/helper hashes to the fixed package install, installed-inbox and active-tree audits, controller/Keychain readiness, and one real first provider reply read back from the authoritative conversation. The same run also proves the full Serenity writer, scoped memory, reconciliation, cost/disclosure and backup-revision gates. Intel and Apple Silicon reports must agree on shared signed release identity and bootstrap hashes, have distinct host-run IDs and matching native architectures, and each pass the linked case. Architecture-specific package/component hashes need not match each other. Missing fields, planned/skipped/not-run cases, synthetic markers, a report from Rosetta, or independent reports without this linkage block the one-line release. This affects `tests/qualification` and `.github/workflows`; no credential or raw model text is evidence.

Revision 9 freezes the **Mac installed package binding and local provider-key capture boundary**. It changes no public operation schema, release descriptor, delivery schema, or Serenity requirement; the component manifest gains one Mac-controller-only executable artifact kind `credential_helper` at exact relative path `bin/zatiti-credential-helper`. Both native amd64 and arm64 must satisfy the same full first-chat release gates; a reduced-capability preview is not implied. In particular the pinned Serenity public protocol, one canonical writer per brain, scoped recall/curation, command reconciliation, cost/disclosure bounds and backup revision behavior remain hard release prerequisites. A missing or unqualified guarantee blocks the release rather than becoming a silent fallback.

**Data-only per-user package.** For each architecture, the signed `zatiti-<version>-darwin-<arch>-installer.pkg` is a single-choice flat product package with a distribution domain allowing only `currentUserHome` (`enable_currentUserHome=true`, `enable_localSystem=false`, `enable_anywhere=false`, no admin authentication). The package contains exactly one component payload rooted at `Library/Application Support/zatiti-installer/inbox/<release_sequence>/<arch>/` relative to the selected home. That inbox contains exactly three owner-only regular files: `binding.json`, `controller.tar.gz`, and `desktop.tar.gz`; it has no install scripts, executable payload, extra component/choice, symlink, hard link or path outside that subtree. The final app, controller version tree, LaunchAgent and state are activated only by the trusted bootstrap's existing `packaging.Apply` path **after** package installation and re-verification; the package itself does not start services or modify the active distribution. A package opened directly in Installer may stage inert bytes but does not constitute an installed/runnable Zatiti release. Incomplete inbox data is quarantined or removed without changing the accepted release. This layout is intentionally separate from the revision-8 accepted watermark and controller state.

The strict canonical UTF-8 `zatiti.mac_pkg_binding/v1` `binding.json` is at most 4096 bytes and has exactly `schema`, positive `release_sequence`, `version`, `arch` (`amd64` or `arm64`), `release_descriptor_sha256`, `controller_sha256`, and `desktop_sha256`; all hashes are lowercase SHA-256. Its descriptor digest covers the **inner canonical signed MacReleaseDescriptor bytes** already verified under revision 7, while the component digests cover the exact archived bytes named by that descriptor's corresponding delivery assets. The bootstrap separately verifies the outer signed delivery record and its installer asset hash. The binding never contains the delivery digest, package digest, URL, signing key, or mutable path: the delivery record contains the package hash, so placing that hash or the delivery digest inside the package would create a circular dependency. The sequence/version/architecture and both component digests must match the already verified delivery plan. Duplicate JSON keys, unknown fields, noncanonical bytes, extra/missing payload entries or unsupported schema fail closed.

Before activation, `packaging` must inspect the actual bounded package payload bytes and script/component inventory, not infer them from `pkgutil --expand` metadata, a receipt, filenames or outer SHA alone. Verify its final download size/SHA against the signed delivery, Developer ID Installer signature and pinned **out-of-band** Team ID/certificate requirement, stapled notarization and local Gatekeeper install assessment; `pkgutil --check-signature`, `xcrun stapler validate` during producer qualification, and `/usr/sbin/spctl --assess --type install --verbose <pkg>` are diagnostic evidence, not substitutes for parsing payload bytes and comparing the exact trusted signer. The end-user bootstrap may use only system tools and native Security APIs; it must not require Xcode, `xcrun` or disabled Gatekeeper. Refuse a failed or unavailable trust check. Invoke only `/usr/sbin/installer -pkg <privately-staged-verified-pkg> -target CurrentUserHomeDirectory` with fixed arguments, no `sudo`, alternate target, script-provided command, or inherited secret. After installer returns, check the installed inbox owner/modes/no symlinks and hash every byte again against the binding and already downloaded components; only then invoke `Apply` to stage the two signed component trees and fixed LaunchAgent, audit both active trees and launcher against the descriptor, and advance the revision-8 watermark while holding its bootstrap lock. A crash between package staging, Apply and fence advancement is reconciled from exact signed bytes and an authoritative active-tree audit; never trust a package receipt or rerun an ambiguous activation blindly. The package verifier/runner must be a real production capability before `RunMacBootstrap` may activate; injected fakes prove only orchestration. Producer CI builds and signs nested code, package-signs the final bytes, notarizes/staples, verifies both architecture-specific packages, then computes delivery hashes and signs the delivery record. The actual Team ID, certificate identity, notarization account, hosting URL, trust-root rotation and native clean-host results are external release inputs/evidence, never invented source constants or completed claims. Apple documents the [per-user distribution domain](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/DistributionDefinitionRef/Chapters/Distribution_XML_Ref.html), [package-signature diagnosis](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/resolving-common-notarization-issues), and [Gatekeeper package assessment](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html); the exact fixed invocation and payload parser still require qualification on supported macOS versions.

**Activation-time master-key custody.** While holding the revision-8 bootstrap lock, after validating/staging the package inbox and before `Apply` may start the controller, the trusted local bootstrap composition injects `platform.ProvisionMacMasterKey(ctx, stateDir) error` into `packaging.RunMacBootstrap` through a narrow `MacMasterKeyProvisioner` capability and calls it for the fixed default state directory. `packaging` never imports `internal/platform` or derives a Keychain service itself. It creates or validates the owner-only 0700 state root and durable 0600 `instance.id` using the platform's existing instance-ID rules, derives the existing service name `com.zatiti.zatiti.v1.<first 16 hex instance characters>`, and addresses exactly the generic-password account `master` in the current user's **login Keychain**. It performs a create-only Security.framework `SecItemAdd` of 32 CSPRNG bytes encoded in the existing SecretStore base64 representation; it must never call the current `Put` replacement path for an existing master item. On `errSecDuplicateItem` or rerun, it reads and strictly decodes the existing item through the same backend, checks exactly 32 key bytes, and retains it unchanged. Lock, ACL refusal, malformed value, missing instance identity, race or uncertain add/read result fails closed; after a crash following a successful add, the next run reads the same item and continues. No master bytes enter stdout, log, argv, environment, database, inbox, package or backup, and temporary mutable copies are cleared where feasible. The provisioning call returns only readiness/typed error, never the bytes or a caller-selected account. It never rotates or deletes the item automatically; upgrade and ordinary uninstall retain both `instance.id` and the Keychain item. Explicit destructive data deletion requires a separate owner action and backup warning. The installed controller LaunchAgent uses `--credential-backend keychain --master-key secret:master` against the exact default state directory; these are fixed nonsecret selectors, not caller input. The GUI helper uses the same fixed selectors internally. Before claiming readiness, verify controller and helper reopen the *same* instance and key. The trusted command/bootstrap composition binds the platform implementation before the controller LaunchAgent starts; a nil production provisioner blocks activation. This is a coordinated `internal/platform` + `packaging` + `cmd/zatiti` capability; a data-only pkg cannot provision the key itself.

**One-line bootstrap entrypoint and trust distribution.** The published command is generated only from final signed/hosted artifacts and contains an immutable literal SHA-256 for a bounded `zatiti-bootstrap.sh` downloaded from one fixed HTTPS origin into an owner-only temporary directory. It downloads the script with redirects disabled, verifies the exact literal hash using system `/usr/bin/shasum`, then invokes `/bin/sh` on that verified local file; it never pipes network bytes to a shell. The short script contains only fixed nonsecret URL/SHA-256 literals for a universal amd64+arm64 `ZatitiBootstrap.app.zip` on that same origin, downloads with redirects disabled and a byte cap, verifies the archive hash, extracts into the private directory using system `/usr/bin/ditto`, rejects extra/symlinked/unsafe entries, verifies the exact signed `ZatitiBootstrap.app` designated identifier and externally pinned Team ID plus stapled notarization/Gatekeeper assessment, then launches only its `Contents/MacOS/zatiti-bootstrap` executable with no user-supplied arguments or inherited secret. The app is a universal, separately signed/notarized native wrapper around `RunMacBootstrap`; it embeds the trusted Ed25519 delivery public keys and fixed stable-channel metadata URL, with no fetched trust key or private key. It detects **hardware** architecture, including Rosetta, and selects only the matching three assets from the verified revision-7 delivery record. The script and app archive hashes are pinned in the release-generated command/script respectively; both must be regenerated when their bytes change. The README/release page is the trusted distribution point for the literal one-line command, and the signed release CI records its URL/hash/Team ID/entitlements/notary evidence, while key rotation ships an overlapping bootstrap before a new delivery signer is used. This bootstrap app is a seventh, independently pinned distribution artifact outside the six-asset delivery record, so it cannot derive its own trust from fetched delivery metadata. A user may also install via a reviewed cask with its own literal package SHA pin. No hostname, command hash, Team ID, signing identity or working public command is filled with a placeholder and advertised before actual hosting, signing, notarization and both clean-host runs. If the universal bootstrap wrapper or its script cannot pass those checks, the one-line install claim is blocked, even if `RunMacBootstrap` unit tests pass.

**Signed native credential helper.** The architecture-matched Mac controller distribution carries one separately signed AppKit executable as manifest artifact kind `credential_helper` at `bin/zatiti-credential-helper`; the desktop bundle continues to carry no secure helper. Its installed path is exactly `$HOME/Library/Application Support/zatiti-dist/current/bin/zatiti-credential-helper`, reached through packaging's owner-checked `current` link. Its signing identifier is `com.zatiti.credential-helper`, with the actual Team ID supplied by trusted release configuration. Verify the helper's declared SHA, architecture, code signature and pinned designated requirement before launch, and use a parent/responsible-process launch constraint requiring the signed Zatiti Flutter Runner. The native Runner alone resolves this fixed installed path from the protected default installation layout and spawns it directly; neither Dart nor discovery metadata supplies an executable path. A Flutter-to-Runner method channel request `zatiti.gui-credential-capture/v1` contains exactly `schema`, lowercase UUID `installation_id`, and lowercase UUID `connection_id`, at most 4096 bytes. It is allowed only for an installed local Mac profile after authenticated installation identity comparison; development/remote/headless modes report capability unavailable. The Runner serializes one capture, uses a bounded cancellation/deadline, and invokes the helper with fixed nonsecret arguments `capture --installation-id <UUID> --connection-id <UUID>` and a sanitized environment/closed unrelated descriptors. No raw provider key, owner header, receipt, store reference, master-key reference, state/socket path or arbitrary argument crosses the method channel or argv/environment. The helper's bounded, strict result to Runner is only `zatiti.gui-credential-capture-result/v1` with `schema`, `status` (`completed`, `cancelled`, `retryable`, `repair_required`), and a fixed nonsecret `reason_code`; it contains no free-form diagnostic, credential, reference or receipt. The Runner returns that redacted result to Dart, which reads authoritative `connection.get` and `connection.setup.status` before showing ready state.

The helper runs in the user's interactive GUI session and presents an `NSSecureTextField` with a locally fetched provider/account label and explicit consent. The field accepts a nonempty bounded UTF-8 provider credential (maximum 4096 bytes); cancel and expiry make no new connection authority. The helper itself resolves strict protected `desktop.json`, authenticates to the private socket using the existing installed owner Keychain item, verifies live installation ID, and uses the fixed installed default state directory and Keychain backend with the fixed nonsecret master key selector `secret:master`. Installer provisioning must establish and retain that master item in the same installation-local login Keychain service; absence, lock, ACL refusal or a mismatched launcher configuration is a named repair prerequisite, never a plaintext fallback. The currently used login-Keychain backend is not silently replaced by a data-protection access group; signed Runner/helper/controller access and continuity across upgrades need real Keychain/ACL qualification. The helper owns `connection.get` → `connection.setup.begin(method=store_reference)` → UI entry → `SecretStore.Put` → helper receipt → `connection.setup.complete` through the same trusted engine as the terminal helper. Both `setup.begin` and `setup.complete` are keyed mutation requests: mint and durably retain one submission key per intended call, pass it in the existing request envelope, and use `command.get` plus challenge/connection status to reconcile an ambiguous response before replaying the same bytes with that same key. A changed challenge/version/receipt requires a new intended call and key, never a blind retry. The existing terminal helper must obey the same rule; its current `callOperation` omits `SubmissionKey` and permissive fakes do not establish correctness. The receipt remains challenge/account/expiry bound and is verified by `internal/connections`; raw bytes never enter a public operation, MCP/model context, stdout/stderr, log, Dart heap, argv or environment. `NSSecureTextField` masks input, but no claim is made that Swift/Foundation/Go process heaps never hold transient copies. The concrete shared bridge is one **process**: build the Go trusted setup engine from `cmd/zatiti` as a Mac-specific `-buildmode=c-archive` target and statically link it into the Swift/AppKit helper. Keep Swift source/bridge headers in the `cmd/zatiti` ownership root and build architecture-specific signed helper binaries for the controller manifest. The narrow C ABI is `Prepare(installationID, connectionID) -> opaque in-process session handle plus bounded nonsecret provider/account label`, `Commit(handle, const uint8_t *credential, size_t length) -> fixed redacted status`, and `Cancel(handle) -> fixed redacted status`; the Go engine owns discovery, Keychain, authenticated operations, submission keys, pending intent, SecretStore and HMAC receipt. Swift obtains the field value only after consent, rejects >4096 UTF-8 bytes, passes a transient byte pointer directly to linked Go code, and clears mutable buffers where feasible. The pointer is never persisted, passed to another process, logged or returned; Go copies only as required for SecretStore.Put and clears its own temporary byte slice. Handles are process-local, unguessable and single-use. The terminal helper calls this same Go engine with its bounded terminal reader. This bridge adds no provider-key IPC and no second HMAC implementation; qualifying the Go c-archive/AppKit link and Swift memory behavior on both CPUs remains mandatory.

After `Put`, the helper records a protected per-challenge pending intent with the opaque store reference and nonsecret replay fields frozen by revision 10 before attempting completion; it is owner-only, bounded, atomic and removed after authoritative completion/cancel/expiry cleanup. An ambiguous `setup.complete` response or helper crash is reconciled by `connection.setup.status` and `connection.get` under the same installation identity before retrying. If completion committed, report completed and retain the referenced key; if pending and unexpired with the same version, reuse its stored reference and receipt; if cancelled/expired/stale, delete only the recorded orphan reference after confirming it is not the effective connection credential. Never silently begin a second challenge or rotate a key to repair a lost response. The helper does not need an XPC service; adding one would require another coordinated protocol and lifecycle. [Apple's secure field](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssecuretextfield), [launch constraints](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/constraining-a-tool%27s-launch-environment), and [legacy Keychain ACLs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/access-control-lists) establish platform concepts, not Zatiti signing or live-provider qualification. This helper contract affects `cmd/zatiti`, `internal/platform`, `internal/connections`, `apps/desktop`, `packaging`, CI and qualification fixtures. No release readiness claim follows until signed native amd64/arm64 UI, locked Keychain, caller-rejection, cancellation, crash and genuine provider/Serenity first-chat tests pass.

Revision 8 freezes only the Mac bootstrap's local replay fence; it changes no public operation, release descriptor, delivery record, or product requirement. `packaging` owns `$HOME/Library/Application Support/zatiti-installer/accepted.json` on macOS, separate from controller state and both distribution trees. Its canonical strict UTF-8 JSON schema `zatiti.mac_accepted_release/v1` has exactly `schema`, positive `release_sequence`, and lowercase 64-digit `delivery_sha256`; the missing file means no release has been accepted. The record is at most 4096 bytes. Its directory is owner-only 0700, the regular file is owner-only 0600, and symlinks, wrong owner, permissive modes, malformed/unknown schema, partial records and corrupt bytes fail closed. Publication uses a same-directory 0600 temporary file, file fsync, atomic rename and directory fsync; it never truncates an accepted record in place. Uninstall retains the fence unless a separate explicit data-deletion action is authorized. A lower sequence or the same sequence with a different signed-delivery digest is rejected. An identical sequence/digest is a no-op only after both installed component trees and launchers audit as that signed release. If activation succeeded but publication failed, a higher-sequence rerun first audits the exact installed release, then advances the fence without invoking installation again. No cached file, package receipt or version string alone proves that audit.

The bootstrap holds a second owner-only advisory lock at `$HOME/Library/Application Support/zatiti-installer/bootstrap.lock` from before reading the fence through post-activation audit and fence publication. This lock serializes competing bootstrap processes; it is distinct from `packaging`'s existing `$HOME/.zatiti-install.lock` because `Apply` acquires that lock inside activation. The bootstrap never holds the existing Apply lock around an Apply call. The lock file is 0600 regular and owner-checked with no symlink traversal; cancellation, process death and failures release the kernel lock. A direct installer and a bootstrap using the same release channel must participate in the bootstrap lock before modifying that channel. Tests cover simultaneous installers, crash after activation before fence, truncated or symlinked record, wrong owner/mode, stale sequence, same-sequence alternate digest, and identical verified reinstall. This is a local packaging contract; `cmd/zatiti`, Flutter, CI and public wire callers gain no new operation or authority. The signed `.pkg` payload, Developer ID Team ID pin, native verifier and fixed activation entrypoint remain unresolved release interfaces; this revision does not authorize running a package or publishing an install command.

Revision 7 adds a downloadable Mac delivery record without changing the already staged `zatiti.mac_release/v1` descriptor or any product operation. A canonical, strict, <=64 KiB `zatiti.mac_delivery/v1` record contains: `schema`; the complete separately signed `MacReleaseDescriptor` and its `MacReleaseSignature`; `channel` (`stable`); positive monotonic `release_sequence`; UTC `published_at` and `expires_at` (at most 30 days apart); and exactly six sorted asset records, one `controller`, one `desktop`, and one `installer` for each of `amd64` and `arm64`. Each asset binds `arch`, `distribution`, exact basename `zatiti-<version>-darwin-<arch>-<distribution>.<extension>` (`tar.gz` for component trees, `pkg` for installer), HTTPS URL, byte size (1..2 GiB), and lowercase SHA-256. URLs have no userinfo, query, fragment, IP literal, traversal, or embedded credential; the basename must match the URL path's final segment and must be unique. Component archives contain the signed component manifest and the exact tree covered by the inner descriptor; the installer package must bind those same components and preserve state. The delivery record has its own Ed25519 signature under domain `zatiti.mac_delivery_signature/v1`, covering the canonical record hash. Its signer is selected only from public keys distributed with the installer/bootstrap or cask, never from a fetched record; key rotation ships overlapping trusted keys before a new signer is used. The signature, time window, sequence and exact assets are checked before any downloaded byte is executed; each download is bounded by signed size, keeps TLS validation, refuses cross-host redirects, verifies exact hash/length, and is staged privately before activation. A protected local sequence watermark refuses downgrade/replay without explicit reviewed recovery.

For a one-line direct installer, the published command must pin the bootstrap script's own SHA-256 (download to a temporary file, verify the literal digest in that command, then run it); a mutable `curl | sh` cannot establish the script's embedded trust key. The bootstrap uses native hardware detection so Apple Silicon under Rosetta selects arm64, chooses only signed delivery assets for that hardware, verifies Developer ID package signature and notarization evidence, and invokes the existing per-user installer without disabling Gatekeeper or installing developer tools. A project cask may instead pin each architecture's package URL and SHA-256 in its formula. Source contains no private signing key, hosting credential or placeholder public release claim. `packaging` owns schemas, offline validation, generation and installer tests; CI binds final signed/notarized bytes and evidence; qualification installs each final artifact on a clean native Intel and Apple Silicon host. No publication or qualified install command follows from synthetic fixtures alone.

Revision 6 freezes the Mac installed-client discovery and owner credential handoff. It adds no public operation or persisted row. The installed Mac release uses the controller's existing default state directory (`os.UserConfigDir()/zatiti`, exactly `$HOME/Library/Application Support/zatiti` on macOS); custom paths remain explicit development configuration. `internal/platform` owns an atomic, owner-only `desktop.json` record in that state directory. Its strict UTF-8 JSON schema is `zatiti.desktop-discovery/v1` and its fields are exactly `schema`, `protocol_version` (integer 1), `socket_path` (absolute local Unix socket path), and, only after committed bootstrap, `installation_id` (lowercase UUID), `keychain_service`, `keychain_account`. No credential, master key reference, provider key, helper executable path or caller-supplied endpoint appears. The record is at most 4096 bytes, has a 0700 parent and 0600 mode, is written by fsync plus atomic rename, and is refused on symlink, wrong owner, permissive mode, malformed/unknown schema, partial post-bootstrap locator or unsafe socket path. A missing record means the controller has not published its location, never that setup is complete. Stale metadata remains for repair after the service stops; the desktop confirms live identity through authenticated `installation.status` before showing user data.

`cmd/zatiti serve` publishes the pre-bootstrap record once its private socket is bound and republishes the initialized record after it reads authoritative `installation.OwnerCredential` from a database snapshot. It does this on every initialized startup and after an `installation.init` commit, including a restart after the commit but before publication; it never reruns init or mints a second owner token to repair publication. The existing CLI profile handoff may continue as a compatibility path, but it must use the same persisted StoreRef rather than an in-memory last-Put value. A missing, revoked or unreadable owner item fails closed with a named prerequisite; locked/unavailable/refused Keychain is distinct from absent metadata and never triggers bootstrap retry or token rotation. `internal/platform` exposes `(*Platform).KeychainLocator(ctx, opaqueRef) (service, account string, err error)` only for a stored, readable Keychain item. It validates the reference and never returns bytes; headless and non-Mac backends refuse capability. The locator corresponds to the exact Keychain generic-password item under the platform's installation-local service and account encoded by the opaque ref. The stored item is base64 of the complete Authorization header value, as current platform custody writes it.

The installed Flutter Mac client reads only this protected metadata by default; explicit environment/remote profiles remain development/advanced overrides. It reads the named login-Keychain item through the pinned `flutter_secure_storage` macOS backend using `MacOsOptions(accountName: keychain_service, usesDataProtectionKeychain: false)` and `read(key: keychain_account)`, strictly decodes one base64 value to a valid complete Authorization header, and supplies it only to `ControllerClient.credentials`. It does not copy the token to another storage item, reveal it in UI/logs, or load controller state files. Before bootstrap, it may call the already-public `installation.init` over the private socket with no credential and `credential_store: os`; it persists the intended owner name and any ambiguous attempt for reconciliation, and does not create a second chief. Once initialized, it waits for the republished locator, authenticates, compares `installation.status`'s installation ID with discovery, and only then opens the pinned chief conversation. Missing service, unreadable metadata, locked/refused Keychain, stale socket, and identity mismatch are distinct repair states. The app never declares chat-ready from socket existence, adapter registration, or successful compilation. This revision affects `internal/platform`, `cmd/zatiti`, `apps/desktop`, and integration/qualification fixtures; packaging's installed LaunchAgent must use the default state path, and qualification must prove signed Keychain access on both Mac architectures and across upgrade. The separate provider-key submission and downloadable release metadata contracts remain unresolved and must be frozen before their dependent tasks are dispatched.

Revision 5 adds `SecretStore.Lookup(ctx, key) (opaqueRef, error)` for trusted code that must recover the current reference for a stable, locally owned secret name. `Put` still returns an opaque reference, and `Get`/`Delete` still accept only such references. Lookup validates the same key bounds as Put, returns `not_found` for a missing key, fails closed when the store is unavailable, and never returns secret bytes or creates a credential. Its result is installation-local and must never appear in a public operation payload, receipt, log, or model context. The helper receipt signer stores its key under `connections/helper/receipt-key`; connection completion resolves that exact name through Lookup and then Get. It must never trust a reference supplied by the receipt or caller. This additive Go interface revision affects `internal/contract`, `internal/platform`, `internal/connections`, `cmd/zatiti`, and their SecretStore test doubles; it changes no wire schema or persisted row.

Revision 4 stages the first distribution on macOS for both native arm64 and amd64. Linux remains the next supported target after its own qualification; Windows and mobile remain later. A Mac release cannot claim Intel or Apple Silicon support from compilation alone: each requires an installed, signed, notarized artifact and clean-host qualification. The product and operation contracts of revision 3 remain in force; this revision changes release dispatch order and platform evidence, not the wire schemas or persisted rows. Required provider, Serenity, backup/restore and other first-release guarantees are not waived by phasing Linux later. Setup must let an installed Mac app reach the pinned personal-chief conversation without environment variables, manual socket paths or manual controller startup; any new helper/discovery or secret-custody interface requires its own coordinated contract before dependent implementation.

Revision 3 changes, each a coordinated revision that code written against revision 2 must follow. Every new field named below is additive and optional on an existing type: no existing required field changed type, name or was removed, so old persisted rows validate unchanged and remain inspectable with the new field simply absent. New tables (`WorkerTurn`, proposal records) and new operations have no prior callers to break.

- **Durable worker turn.** Execution owns a persisted `WorkerTurn` (see the embedded `WorkerTurn`/`TurnSource` schemas in `internal/execution`'s generated prompt) keyed by unique `(installation_id, source_kind, source_id, source_version, recipient_worker_id)`; re-admission through `_execution.turn.admit` returns the same turn. A pending inbox message and its turn admission/processed marker (`_messaging.processed`) commit in one shared transaction. A message arriving during an active turn is admitted as a safe-boundary injection durably linked to that turn, never silently dropped or processed twice. One active decision stream exists per worker/task lane; different eligible workers may run concurrently within aggregate limits. Each model step/proposal is stored separately as a `ProposalRecord` keyed by unique `(turn_id, step_index, proposal_id)`; the same key with different bytes is `submission_conflict`.
- **Worker turn pipeline operations.** `_execution.work.pending`/`.claim`, `_execution.context.prepare`/`.commit`, `_execution.proposal.prepare`/`.record`, `_execution.report`, `_execution.verification.pending`/`.claim`, `_tasks.evidence.record`, `_tasks.dependencies.wake`, `_messaging.ready`/`.processed` are new internal operations driving the durable worker loop end to end (admit → claim work → prepare/commit context → dispatch a model or tool effect → record the proposal → report → independently verify). Public `task.start` transitions an eligible draft/ready task to ready and enqueues its run in the same transaction; `task.create`/`task.assign` are unchanged. Exact schemas, callers and behavior are embedded in the generated prompts of `internal/execution`, `internal/tasks` and `internal/messaging`.
- **Worker operation executor.** A narrow `contract.WorkerOperator` capability (declared below) lets a worker-authored local proposal invoke an ordinary public operation under the worker's own authenticated actor, scope-intersected with the task/source authorization envelope. It resolves the actor from the persisted turn/worker mapping; `WorkerID` is an asserted match against that turn, never a way to select any principal. Local model-visible operations are an explicit allowlist (authorized configuration authoring/inspection, task/delegation/responsibility actions, approved memory/messaging operations, output publication); grant/policy changes, secrets, internal bookkeeping and human review never become available merely because they exist in the public catalog. The controller's administrative identity authorizes scheduling/bookkeeping only, never a model proposal. **Public/internal caller fix:** `task.assign` is a public operation and carries no caller allowlist (the registry rejects a public descriptor with callers — confirmed 2026-09-18 descriptor-drift finding in docs/roadmap.md); a chief-driven assignment is an ordinary authenticated `task.assign` call made through this executor under the requesting worker's own actor, not a domain-internal caller path.
- **Effects callback routing.** `Operation` gains optional `attempts` (`{attempt_id, generation}` pairs, additive alongside the unchanged `attempt_ids`) and optional `callback_route`; `Dispatch` gains the matching optional `callback_route`. `_effects.prepare` accepts an optional `callback_route` (`CallbackRoute`: `worker_turn`/`job`/`memory`/`skill`/`connection` plus the relevant turn/step/job id) persisted alongside the action and returned at claim. The controller resolves callback routing from this persisted route; it never infers routing by inserting an undeclared `attempt_id` into strict adapter parameters (fixes audit finding G05). `_effects.record` gains an optional `current_generation` for the successor-generation rule: a stray attempt is `not_sent` if never actually claimed under its recorded generation, `outcome_unknown` if claimed but unconfirmed — never silently dropped.
- **Effects reconciliation reaches `Adapter.Reconcile`.** New `_effects.reconciliation.prepare`/`.record` create a separately admitted, separately authorized and accounted bounded reconciliation read distinct from the original write, merging the qualified observation into the original operation's uncertainty without overwriting history or replaying the original action (fixes audit finding G13).
- **Job registry linkage.** `_execution.job.create` gains an optional `operation_id`, linking a network-backed job to its originating effects `Operation` at creation so reconciliation resolves it without scanning another owner's table; a job without `operation_id` is an ordinary local runner. New `_skills.evaluation.record` and `_configuration.export.prepare`/`.record` route skill evaluation and configuration export/import through this durable job ledger instead of handler-local ID minting with no owner-backed lookup (fixes audit findings G11, G12).
- **Registry lookup and schema normalization (already implemented; confirmed for revision 3).** `Lookup(id, 0)` resolves the highest registered version for that operation id. The registry accepts either a bare `$defs`-relative schema or a fully self-contained document at registration, and `Lookup` always returns a self-contained document pruned to reachable `$defs`. These two rules were implemented and tested against application's assumptions before this revision; this entry is their authored record (docs/roadmap.md, 2026-09-18).
- **CLI root tokens (clarification, no schema change).** `Descriptor.CLI` is the subcommand path only and excludes the binary name; `cmd/zatiti` prepends `zatiti` once at command-tree assembly. Generated `AGENTS.md` prose shows the full invocation (for example "CLI `zatiti artifact export`") for readability — that rendering convenience is not part of the wire contract, and an implementer must not treat the printed binary name as part of `Descriptor.CLI` (this ambiguity produced a wrong descriptor token shape in 11 modules; docs/roadmap.md, 2026-09-18).
- **Service-principal bootstrap.** `_identity.bootstrap` gains optional `service_credential_id`/`service_store_ref` so the bootstrap-created controller service principal can receive a credential in the same transaction, letting an out-of-process controller authenticate; omitted fields leave the service principal credential-less for the in-process explicit-`Actor` seam, unchanged from revision 2.
- **Review eligibility (ruling, confirmed for revision 3).** The eligible reviewer of an exact review-class request is the human principal whose current authority admitted that request; services, workers and agents are never eligible, and proposer separation stays mandatory for them. This settles "an eligible owner's decision" left undefined in revision 2's policy/reviews briefs (docs/roadmap.md, 2026-09-18 evening REVISION-3 RULING).
- **Internal authority checks (ruling, confirmed for revision 3).** `_identity.authority`, like every internal operation, is gated by its caller allowlist and by the calling actor being a registered, unrevoked principal in the transaction's installation — never by requiring the calling actor to independently hold the capability named in its own request. A standing grant of `_identity.authority` to work around a circular subject-capability check is unnecessary and must not be relied upon (docs/roadmap.md, 2026-09-19 REVISION-3 RULING). Whether an actor may read another principal's authority is an explicit code-level decision this ruling does not settle; downstream implementers must document it in place rather than infer it.
- **Artifact locator staging (confirmed unchanged).** `PhysicalCallEvidence.request_context` and `ModelOutput.request_context` remain the revision-2 `ArtifactLocator` retype; revision 3 makes no further change here and extends the same staged/artifact pattern to `_execution.context.commit`'s `staged_context`.
- **Responses `prepare_session`/`model_step` split.** See "OpenAI Responses session preparation" below.
- **Small query/result additions.** `conversation.get`/`.list` return the calling principal's optional `caller_unread_count`/`caller_last_read_marker`; new public `conversation.message.list` reads authorized message history for one conversation. New public `memory.list` lists authorized scoped claim refs (source/freshness/lineage/supported actions) without performing paid retrieval. `Artifact` gains optional `source_operation_id`/`purpose` (provenance). `Status` gains optional `runtime_ready`. `Responsibility` gains optional `last_cycle_id`, and `_scheduling.cycle.record` gains a required `cycle_id` replay/conflict fence plus optional `turn_id` linkage. New public `installation.verifier.list` enumerates installed trusted verifier profiles (secret-free) so a task's acceptance contract can name one. `event.list`'s drained-cursor/filter/scope/principal/retention behavior is unchanged; this is its explicit revision-3 confirmation, not a schema change. Public task/turn status projection and installed-capability desktop surfacing are explicitly deferred to `internal/evidence` (P34) and `apps/desktop` (P42) rather than invented here.
- **Local decision tools pinned separately from provider tools.** `ReplyProposal`, `ClarifyProposal`, `ReportOutputsProposal` and `CycleDecisionProposal` (schemas below) are the sealed names/inputs for the context builder's non-provider decision tools (`reply`, `clarify`, `report_outputs`, `cycle_decision`). They are execution-local proposals evaluated by the worker operation executor, never routed through a `connections.Tool`/adapter and never given a provider operation mapping; a final text answer alone may complete a chat turn but never implicitly fulfills a task's required outputs.
- Desktop client (ADR 002): the desktop is a Flutter application at `apps/desktop` that is a direct wire client of internal/server. The Go roots `internal/desktop` and `cmd/zatiti-desktop` are retired; no Go package may import or stand in for the desktop.
- Adapter request context: `PhysicalCallEvidence.request_context` and `ModelOutput.request_context` are an `ArtifactLocator`, not a bare `ArtifactRef`. Adapters return the staged variant; the controller publishes it and substitutes the artifact variant in normalized evidence.
- Installation database seam: `contract.DatabaseBackup` is a one-method capability that entrypoint assembly supplies only to internal/installation through `installation.WithDatabaseBackup`. `contract.Dependencies` is unchanged and no domain gains general database access.

## Build and dependency decisions

Module `github.com/zatiti/zatiti`; language `go 1.26.0`; initial toolchain `go1.26.2`. Integration owns go.mod/go.sum. The Flutter desktop pins its own Flutter/Dart SDK and plugins in `apps/desktop/pubspec.lock`; integration records those pins and licenses in the same lock report and the Go module never depends on them. Domains import standard library and internal/contract, not sibling domains. Application composes owner methods through a checked in-process dispatcher: ordinary Go calls, not another server or scheduler.

Library families: Cobra CLI; official MCP Go SDK, handwritten adapter for MCP `2025-11-25`; Flutter (Dart) desktop application at `apps/desktop` with an operating-system secure-storage plugin, outside the Go module; modernc.org/sqlite. Mint is optional build-time tooling and cannot weaken contracts. Hosted provider v1: a specifically qualified OpenAI Responses endpoint/profile, with configured model and prices. Other compatible endpoints remain unavailable until qualified. GitHub uses documented REST over net/http, with mutation retries disabled. Serenity is a separate pinned service using public interfaces only. Integration must resolve exact dependency releases/commits, checksums, licenses and qualification commands in a lock report BEFORE dispatching dependent implementation. These are selected implementation families, not claims that upstream behavior has been qualified. No agent independently substitutes libraries, models, prices, accounts or Serenity APIs. Dependency resolution/qualification is an explicit foundation assignment.

## Shared Go declarations

The contract owner implements these exact declarations. Omitted function bodies are the implementation assignment, not production stubs. Public JSON uses snake_case. Schema-derived DTO names concatenate operation path segments in PascalCase plus Input/Output and live in the owning package. JSON integer => int64, UUID => contract.ID, timestamp => time.Time, optional scalar => pointer, array => slice, explicitly open JSON => json.RawMessage. Unknown fields are rejected.

The registry binds concrete input/output DTO types to descriptors and handlers using `Bind[I, O any](descriptor contract.Descriptor, fn func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. JSON decoding is strict and schema validation precedes execution. Internal cross-owner calls use the same schema-checked Invocation boundary to avoid sibling package imports. They retain the same Unit, actor, scope, generation and transaction; cannot mint authority; and are not exposed as public operations.

## Transaction and ownership rules

Each domain owns tables prefixed with its package name and `_`. Schema and migration bodies inside that namespace are package-private; no other package depends on their layout. Storage owns installation generation, migration metadata and `storage_events`. Evidence owns commands/receipts. Migration ordering is explicit in application assembly. All migrations run under exclusive installation ownership before serving. Cross-owner reads and changes use Ports.Call and the embedded internal schemas. Internal operations have a caller allowlist. The dispatcher detects recursive calls. Queries cannot invoke mutation descriptors. Public clients cannot supply Actor or Unit or invoke internal operations.

One controller, one ordered writer, WAL, foreign keys on every connection, synchronous FULL, busy timeout 5 seconds, consistent read snapshots. Database.Write performs ONE transaction callback attempt with no automatic callback retry. Busy exhaustion returns controller_unavailable/retryable. Unit is valid only inside its callback; no goroutines or retained handles. Unit.Emit appends state-correlated evidence to the storage outbox in the same transaction. Delivery is at least once and consumers deduplicate event IDs. No network/model calls, secret-store access, filesystem streaming or subprocess work inside a Unit. Stage bytes or local helper actions outside transactions, then publish metadata or reconciliation intent through owner methods.

Handler errors roll back the entire transaction. Persist a command refusal in a separate short transaction after rollback where necessary, retaining the original request identity. Query command IDs need not be durable. All mutations return durable command IDs; accepted responses must identify inspectable durable work. Output schemas describe Payload.Data, not the result envelope. Never leak SQL, tokens, provider raw responses or private paths through Fault.

Definition creates/updates/archive stage drafts, including schedules, responsibilities, policies and memory bindings. Only configuration.apply activates definitions. It validates owners' candidate slices, seals base revision/dependencies/requirements, and calls internal activate in the same transaction under old authority. Internal activate is admitted only from the compiler during exact plan application, not by a public flag. Public restrictive pause/revoke/cancel commits immediately without compilation or spending. Archive staging may immediately disable new admissions as an explicitly reported restrictive side effect; final removal waits for obligations.

## Effect and execution rules

Admit: current authorization, exact review/preconditions, all budget reservations, attempt/dispatch intent and evidence atomically. Claim: second transaction rechecks generation/restrictions/expiry and consumes the one-use claim. Invoke the adapter outside transactions. Record: third transaction stores observations, costs or retained uncertainty and events. Each physical call, including reconciliation and retries, has a distinct attempt. Reconciliation is an admitted bounded read and links to the original effect; it does not overwrite history. Internal jobs use explicitly provisioned scoped service identities plus current worker/task restrictions.

Once claimed, crash/timeout/cancel/lease expiry/operator acknowledgement/weak not-found cannot prove nonexecution. Preserve outcome_unknown and its reservation until authoritative evidence. Earlier unknown attempts survive later failures. Mutation SDK/HTTP retries are disabled. Even qualified idempotent retries need fresh authorization and physical-attempt evidence. Trusted adapters resolve credential references outside transactions; no public raw secrets or inherited owner credential environment. Fencing external workers blocks Zatiti mutations but cannot prove their processes stopped.

Task success needs independently established acceptance against pinned verifier code/version, sealed inputs and observations. Worker report/exit zero cannot set succeeded. Defaults: one concurrent attempt/worker, four/installation, 30 minutes/attempt, 100 model steps, eight children, delegation depth three, root deadline 24 hours. Configure explicit currency and finite spend limits before paid work. Amounts are int64 micro-units with checked overflow; rational rates use integer numerator/denominator and round reservations upward. Unknown/advisory usage and missing prices are not zero. Children share root and ancestor budgets.

## Wire conventions and limits

UUIDv4 for new identities; stable UUID references thereafter. SHA-256 lowercase hex digests. Versioned canonical JSON sorts keys, rejects duplicate keys/unknown fields, preserves exact integer values and semantic array order; schema-declared sets sort by stable identity. Preserve exact skill bytes. UTC RFC3339Nano timestamps and int64 versions >=1. Patches and snapshots are distinct; explicit delete only. Inert `extensions` alone permits namespaced extra keys. Scope is explicit and every referenced object is revalidated; no implicit global organization.

Default limits: JSON request 1 MiB; chunk 1 MiB decoded; artifact 256 MiB; skill archive 16 MiB compressed, 64 MiB expanded, 4096 entries, depth 32; list 50/max 200; read 1 MiB; redacted log record 8 KiB; event page 100/max 500; upload expiry 24 hours. Narrowing is allowed, increases require authorized configuration. Reject overflow and unsupported bounds.

Mutations require submission_key (1..128 printable ASCII) except one-time init. Bind principal, operation/version and canonical input hash. Retain >=30 days and through unresolved obligations. Replay identical input returns original disposition BEFORE stale-version validation; changed input => submission_conflict. Concurrent duplicates serialize. Recover lost acknowledgements by command lookup, not a new key. Resource updates require expected_version; apply requires base_revision and plan digest. Creation has no existing version. Opaque authenticated cursors bind principal/scope/filter/order/snapshot and expire explicitly with cursor_expired and snapshot_required=true. Event replay cannot silently omit a gap.

HTTP POST `/v1/operations/{operation_id}` uses the common request envelope. Local HTTP runs over a private Unix socket. The Flutter desktop is a direct client of this endpoint: the private Unix socket locally and, for an explicitly configured remote desktop, mutual TLS mapped to current application principals over the same operation contract, never remote MCP. It shares the envelope, fault mapping, limits, submission-key replay and cursor rules with every other client, holds no business logic or database access, and consumes the generated operation catalog rather than any Go package. Completed => HTTP 200; accepted => 202. Failed mapping: invalid_input 400, permission_denied 403, not_found 404, stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict/review_required/outcome_unknown/artifact_fault 409, cursor_expired 410, prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported/verification_failed 422, controller_unavailable 503, internal_error 500. Domain failures always include the result envelope.

CLI completed/accepted => exit 0; invalid_input 2; permission_denied/review_required 3; stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict 4; prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported 5; controller_unavailable/outcome_unknown 6; other failures 1. CLI --json emits one envelope to stdout, diagnostics stderr, no implicit prompts. MCP structuredContent is the full envelope, text is equivalent JSON, failed => isError true, malformed protocol => protocol error. Dot-separated operation IDs map to CLI tokens and `zatiti_` MCP names. Exceptions: installation.init => `zatiti init` / `zatiti_installation_init`; capabilities.list => `zatiti capabilities` / `zatiti_capabilities`. Lifecycle steps are individual tools. Tool input never selects a credential profile or accepts raw secrets/unrestricted server paths.

## Completion policy

Write only within the assigned root. Do not edit this prompt, siblings, shared contracts, root dependencies or external acceptance inputs. Implement exact fake dependencies locally; do not return invented production success for unavailable prerequisites. Use controlled providers, deterministic clocks and synthetic fixtures. Preserve expected/observed results and failure evidence. Package tests prove local properties; actual subprocess parity, crash recovery, desktop and adapter qualification prove integration. Z01-Z21 and first-release journeys must pass on both Intel and Apple Silicon macOS before the Mac release is claimed; Linux requires its own later qualification before Linux support is advertised.

## Local IO, authentication, jobs and verification seams

These additional declarations are part of the SAME frozen contract package (using imports already shown). Implementing an interface does not permit calling it inside a Unit except where the signature explicitly takes Unit/Reader.

### Restore protocol (revision 3)

The six-step offline restore protocol (contract-proposals.md section 7) is split across two owners as shipped, not implemented by a single entrypoint-owned capability supplied to `internal/installation` alone: `internal/installation`'s public `installation.restore` operation performs steps 1-3 without ever touching the live database file, and `internal/controller` performs steps 4-6. `installation.restore` runs the same synchronous LocalIO Prepare/Perform/Finish flow as `installation.backup` (`internal/installation/restore.go`): Prepare requires exclusive maintenance, validates the pinned backup artifact and creates the durable job; Perform (outside any transaction) decrypts and verifies the uploaded bundle's binding, integrity and framed image, then — before any rewind — exports a sealed, published `RecoveryOverlay` document of this installation's CURRENT pre-restore state (source database digest from the `DatabaseBackup` capability, plus the obligations `snapshotObligations` captured at Prepare time from pending effects and unresolved memory writes); Finish registers that overlay artifact and leaves the job `running` with an `external_action_required` requirement naming the verified backup image. `internal/installation` never swaps the SQLite file itself: a domain module cannot replace the live database out from under its own open handle mid-process, so the installation stays merely paused, not yet rewound, once `installation.restore` completes.

That handoff is driven forward by `RestoreLifecycle`, declared in `internal/controller` (`internal/controller/restore.go`) — not `contract.SnapshotInventory`/`contract.RestoreCoordinator` as this section previously described; no such contract-package types exist. `RestoreLifecycle` has two methods: `StageCandidate(ctx context.Context, restoreJobID contract.ID, dir string) (RestoreCandidate, error)` resolves the job's already-verified backup artifact into a locally staged, decrypted candidate database file, and `MergeOverlay(ctx context.Context, u contract.Unit, restoreJobID contract.ID) error` folds the already-captured `RecoveryOverlay` into every owner's own tables monotonically — never resurrecting a revoked credential, resending a consumed dispatch or erasing a liability absent from the older snapshot — inside one transaction. It is a field of `controller.Collaborators` (`RestoreLifecycle RestoreLifecycle`), attached through `Controller.Attach` exactly like `Verifier`/`Operator`/`Blobs`: only entrypoint assembly may supply an implementation, because only it has direct Go access to `internal/installation`'s private bundle/key/overlay code, and the controller itself never decrypts a backup bundle or resolves a secret reference. `cmd/zatiti/restore.go` defines the one production implementation (unexported `restoreLifecycle{}`); `cmd/zatiti/serve.go`'s `superviseController` wires it into `Collaborators.RestoreLifecycle` alongside every other trusted collaborator before `ctl.Attach(collab)`.

Once a job reaches `running`/`external_action_required`, the controller's own tick flow claims it and `runRestore` drives the remaining steps: quiesce admission and drain every other in-flight unit (`drainOrdinary`), stage the candidate image via `RestoreLifecycle.StageCandidate` and hand it to `storage.Restorable.PrepareRestore`/`CommitRestore` for the atomic file-level swap and generation advance (`performSwap`), fold the overlay via `RestoreLifecycle.MergeOverlay` inside the transaction `storage.Restorable.WriteRestoreOverlay` opens on the freshly reopened, still-paused database, then call `storage.Restorable.ResumeAfterRestore` to lift the write gate (`mergeAndResume`), and finally report the durable disposition back to `internal/installation` through its own internal `_installation.restore.record` operation (`failRestore`/`settleRestore`). A controller lifetime that itself performs the swap cannot continue afterward: its `*application.Application` was built over the now-closed pre-restore database handle and there is no seam to repoint it, so `Controller.Run` returns the `ErrRestoreHandoff` sentinel error — not a fault — the instant the swap, overlay merge and storage resume are durable. `cmd/zatiti`'s `runServe` is an outer loop around exactly this signal: on `ErrRestoreHandoff` it calls `reassembleAfterRestoreHandoff` (closes the stale `Application` and database, reopens storage at the same path — which already observes the swap — and calls `Database.StartGeneration` again to fence out the lifetime that just ended) under the SAME held installation lock, then runs again. A crash mid-protocol recovers the same way at the next startup: `recoverRestoreBeforeFence` runs before the ordinary generation fence and drives any journal entry left open forward from its last durable phase, re-checking `storage.Restorable.RestorePaused` rather than trusting the last written phase, so it never repeats an already-committed swap or loses track of one.

Current state, honestly: production's only `RestoreLifecycle` implementation, `cmd/zatiti`'s `restoreLifecycle{}`, fails both methods closed with `contract.CodePrerequisiteMissing` rather than guessing or fabricating success — exactly the fallback `Collaborators.RestoreLifecycle`'s own doc comment designs for. `StageCandidate` fails because no operation, public or internal, exposes a pending restore job's original backup-artifact reference to entrypoint assembly (public `job.get`'s wire projection never carries `Input`; only the controller's own internal `_execution.job.claim` call does, and that result stays in the controller's private journal entry). `MergeOverlay` fails because no owner-defined merge operation yet exists in `internal/effects`, `internal/identity` or `internal/memory` to fold a `RecoveryOverlay`'s obligations into their own tables, and because credential/grant revocation obligations are never captured into the overlay to begin with: `snapshotObligations` (`internal/installation/restore.go`) records only `claimed_effect`/`unknown_effect` and `memory_write` obligation kinds. This is a scoped, tracked gap — new merge operations spanning effects/identity/memory, revocation-obligation capture in `snapshotObligations`, a job-input lookup path for `StageCandidate` — not a defect in what shipped: a restore observed without a working merge/staging path is recorded failed with `prerequisite_missing`, and the database is never touched by an incomplete attempt. A clean destination additionally needs a secure key-transfer/provisioning route; an opaque source secret-store reference alone is not portability. Missing required Serenity export guarantees blocks a full-memory backup claim; an empty `Brains` array must never be reported complete.

Identity Service also implements Authenticator. Application receives this interface explicitly in New; it uses a dedicated read snapshot and never reads identity-owned tables itself. Only the byte-slice credential boundary carries secret authentication material, never Invocation JSON. Zero sensitive buffers after use where practical; no logging. Certificate authentication resolves a preprovisioned credential reference and follows the same current principal/revocation rules.

Artifacts, skills, connections and installation Services also implement LocalIO. The registry detects this interface at assembly and routes ONLY registered local IO operations through Prepare/Perform/Finish: artifact.upload.chunk/finish/cancel/read/export; skill.import; connection.setup.begin/complete/cancel; installation.init/backup/restore. LocalIO handles local bounded files, secure helpers and backup work, never unadmitted provider/model calls. Prepare strictly validates input, versions, identity and authority and records replayable local intent under IOPlan.ID; Perform receives that exact trusted in-memory plan outside transactions, resolves opaque staging/helper references, and returns metadata; Finish rechecks authority/versions/generation and commits result/evidence. IOPlan is never public, accepted from an agent or stored with secrets. Prepared/Data JSON must use the operation's declared schemas plus private owner-local metadata, which no other package reads. No cross-owner business protocol may hide in those private fields. Perform must support safe replay of local staging/publication by plan ID, or preserve an inspectable failed/unknown local obligation. A synchronous read does not return bytes to client until final authorization check. New raw provider writes always use effects, not this interface.

For synchronous local IO mutations, persist command identity plus accepted internal pending disposition at Prepare, then replace pending disposition once at Finish. Concurrent same-key calls join/inspect that same in-progress command and never run duplicate Perform. The controller can recover abandoned local intents using the execution job API. Async backup/export uses the same interface with an inspectable job returned immediately. The artifact.upload.chunk endpoint has a 2 MiB encoded request cap (all other ordinary JSON requests 1 MiB), allowing the specified 1 MiB decoded chunk plus envelope.

Execution owns shared durable jobs (execution_jobs), distinct from runs and physical effects. `_execution.job.create` stores the original owner/operation/input and idempotent source identity; public job.get inspects any authorized job. Controller lists pending jobs, claims generation-bound ownership, invokes the named LocalIO owner outside transactions through its exact plan, and records result/obligation. Network jobs first prepare effects and wait on their recorded outcomes. `_execution.job.record` stores result data matching the originating operation's explicit completion_schema and links actual artifact/operation evidence. Never mark a job succeeded merely because its physical request was accepted.

Tasks calls `_execution.enqueue` with ready pinned task inside the same transaction; execution creates one run for task/version and returns it. `_tasks.ready` also exposes a bounded recovery scan. Execution's verifier constructor is `NewVerifier(contract.VerifierDependencies) (contract.Verifier,error)`. Verify executes outside Unit and returns actual independently established observations under the pinned accepted profile; `_execution.verification.record` rechecks attempt/task/version before changing task state. A forged worker-provided VerificationResult is never accepted through public report. Concrete context/adapter/verification payload schemas are included in relevant prompts.

Administrative effects that have no task use their command/operation ID as an accountable admission root; no fictional worker/task or fabricated task foreign key is required. Accounting skips absent scope dimensions but always reserves installation and present organization ancestors/project limits. Task effects additionally share root_task_id. A profile without enforceable charge bounds cannot claim a hard cap.

Typed handler bindings return `contract.Outcome[O]` so accepted results and page cursors survive typed registration. The frozen Bind signature is `Bind[I, O any](contract.Descriptor, func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. Errors carry Fault and roll back, while accepted/completed status and cursor come from Outcome.

Assembly order: application.NewPorts() returns an unbound *PortRouter; For(owner string) returns an owner-bound contract.Ports without domain calls; construct identity and all other modules with those ports, passing installation.WithDatabaseBackup(backup-only wrapper over the opened Database) to installation.New and to no other constructor; registry.New(modules); application.New(db, registry, identityAuthenticator, clock, ids); router.Bind(app) exactly once; start serving only after Bind. PortRouter exposes `For(string) contract.Ports` and `Bind(*Application) error`, rejects pre-bind invocation, and never allows a domain to change its bound caller identity. Registry also implements Module for its own capabilities methods. Constructor execution must not query peers or start goroutines.

All native BlobStore objects are encrypted at rest (including public-classification content), because Stage has no classification argument. Metadata publication sets encrypted=true; classification separately governs disclosure. Controller records the raw adapter observation and cost disposition durably first, then publishes StagedOutput bytes outside Unit, then commits artifact metadata and normalized owner callbacks through an outbox consumer. Publication failure is a visible artifact obligation and blocks task/job acceptance; it does not erase a confirmed provider observation or authorize resending. The adapter cannot mint artifact IDs: AdapterDependencies carries no IDSource and BlobStore.Stage returns only a staging reference, digest and size. The same handoff covers the request record. Each adapter stages its exact secret-free request before sending and names it in `physical_call.request_context` as a staged ArtifactLocator with a matching StagedOutput of purpose context; the controller publishes it with the other staged bytes, for every disposition including not_sent and unknown, and delivers normalized evidence whose request_context is the artifact variant. The raw recorded observation keeps the staged locator and is never rewritten.

Installation alone needs the bytes of a consistent SQLite backup: BackupManifest requires database_digest/database_size and RecoveryOverlay requires source_database_digest, while Dependencies {Clock, IDs, Ports, Secrets, Blobs} deliberately exposes no database. The seam is the DatabaseBackup capability above and these exact declarations in internal/installation: `type Option func(*Service)`; `func WithDatabaseBackup(contract.DatabaseBackup) Option`; `func New(contract.Dependencies, ...Option) (*Service, error)`. `New(deps)` without options stays valid, so the common domain constructor shape holds. Dependencies gains no field and no other module receives the capability. Entrypoint assembly passes a wrapper value whose method set is exactly Backup and which delegates to the opened contract.Database, never the Database value itself; installation must not type-assert the capability to any wider interface or retain it beyond the Service. Installation calls Backup only from LocalIO.Perform for installation.backup and for the pre-restore recovery overlay, never inside a Unit, streaming through a hashing writer into BlobStore.Stage so database_digest/database_size and source_database_digest describe the exact staged bytes without unbounded buffering or a caller-supplied path. The capability grants no query, write, migration, event-feed or file-path access and is not the restore rewind mechanism. When the option is absent, installation.backup and installation.restore fail prerequisite_missing naming the database backup capability; they never fabricate a digest, and every other installation operation is unaffected.

Entrypoint assembly owns platform.Acquire -> storage.Open -> Migrate -> Database.StartGeneration, exactly once before controller/server admission. Pass the held contract.Ownership into controller.New; controller never acquires a second lock or advances generation again. Ownership.Lost closes when ownership is lost/released; stop admission immediately. Generation is a persisted local-controller fence, not distributed locking. The installation lock is retained until controller shutdown and DB close.

Remote TLS additionally validates the certificate chain and maps the SHA-256 certificate SPKI fingerprint through application.AuthenticateCertificate(ctx,Digest), which delegates to identity Authenticator.AuthenticateCertificate on a read snapshot. Only a verified TLS peer can enter that API; operation input cannot supply the fingerprint. Store certificate fingerprints as identity-owned authentication metadata on an explicitly provisioned credential reference. If a bearer credential is also supplied, its principal must match the verified certificate principal. No self-asserted certificate name, profile name or fingerprint header grants authority.

Every async operation declares completion_schema separately from its immediate Job response. job.get returns that schema as Job.result only when established; pending jobs omit result. Local IO mutations that may be recovered asynchronously accept either their completed resource output or `{job: Job}` in the descriptor output schema. Bootstrap remains synchronous under its exclusive one-time lock. No unspecified job kind may execute: _execution.job.create requires a registered completion_schema or a specifically registered private local-intent recovery contract.

Evidence retains the complete original result envelope for command replay, including fault message/details/retryability and cursor; projections of status/data/error_code must agree with Command.result. `_evidence.command.finish` takes that exact result. A replay cannot reconstruct a different error or lose an accepted job reference. ScopeRequired lists installation_id where input scope is required; resource-specific organization/project/worker conditions are enforced by the owned operation schemas and current referenced-resource validation, never inferred from a profile name.

Descriptor.Callers carries the exact catalog internal caller allowlist into runtime registration; application enforces this metadata rather than inventing it from operation names. Internal metadata remains available to trusted assembly/registry while public capability output contains public operations only. An empty allowlist never authorizes an internal call.

## OpenAI Responses session preparation (revision 3)

The checked-in `internal/adapters/responses` adapter created a provider conversation and then called Responses inside one `Invoke`, which is two physical requests behind a contract that specifies exactly one physical call per claimed effect (audit finding G27). Revision 3 freezes the split into two explicit effects, each making one physical call, with a persisted session handle passed between them:

- `prepare_session` — `kind: "prepare_session"` — creates the provider conversation and returns its authoritative handle as `ResponsesEvidence.session_handle` (a stable provider-issued string, never fabricated locally). **Disclosure:** the action carries no model-visible content beyond what an empty conversation creation requires; no `context_artifact` is sent. **Timeout:** a timeout after the request was sent leaves the session unknown, not absent — the caller must not create a second session on an unconfirmed `prepare_session` outcome; it waits for recovery. **Cost:** session creation itself is not billed by the pinned protocol; usage is `unknown`/advisory only if the provider's behavior deviates from that pin. **Unknown outcome:** if session creation may have succeeded but its response was lost, retain the unknown outcome without resending — a fresh `prepare_session` could create a second, unlinked provider conversation.
- `model_step` — `kind: "model_step"` — names the persisted session handle (`ResponsesParameters.session_handle`, required) and sends the model input (`context_artifact`, `max_output_tokens`, `tool_contract_versions`). **Disclosure:** exactly the pinned `context_artifact`; no other model-visible bytes. **Timeout:** a timeout after bytes were sent is `outcome_unknown`; an empty item list is equally consistent with "never ran" and "still running" (the provider documents no conversation search), so nonexecution is never assumed. **Cost:** reserved against the profile's accepted token bound before dispatch; a lookup that finds output but no usage cannot release the worst-case billing liability, so it stays reserved. **Unknown outcome:** preserved exactly as any other adapter unknown — no automatic fresh call, no silent retry.

`ResponsesParameters` is versioned to require `kind` (`prepare_session` | `model_step`) as a discriminator; `model_step` additionally requires `session_handle`. `session_handle` is scoped to the same conversation/context lineage as the turn that created it and is never reused across turns. P13 implements both translations against the pinned protocol; P15 consumes the resolved handle when preparing a `model_step` action; P12/P23 journal and dispatch each effect separately through the callback-routed `_effects.prepare`/`.record` pipeline above, so a lost `prepare_session` acknowledgement and a lost `model_step` acknowledgement are two independently recoverable unknowns, never conflated into one. Exact `ResponsesParameters`/`ResponsesEvidence` field-level schemas are frozen in `docs/implementation/adapter-schemas.json` and embedded in `internal/adapters/responses`'s generated prompt; this section is the coordinated-revision record for why they carry a `kind` discriminator and a `session_handle`, not a description of a new adapter behavior beyond the split itself.

## Local decision tool schemas (revision 3)

`ReplyProposal { text }`, `ClarifyProposal { question }`, `ReportOutputsProposal { bindings: [{name, artifact}] }` and `CycleDecisionProposal { decision: continue|wait|escalate|done, reason, next_wake? }` are frozen in `docs/implementation/operations.json`'s `$defs` (via `tools/specgen/model.py`) as `LocalDecisionTool`, a `oneOf` over the four. They are the sealed names/inputs contract-proposals.md section 4 requires before P16 interprets model output: execution-local proposals the context builder registers as non-provider tool definitions, never routed through a `connections.Tool`/adapter and never given a provider operation mapping. A final `reply` alone may complete a chat turn; it never implicitly fulfills a task's required outputs, which only `report_outputs` (bound through `_tasks.evidence.record`) can do.


## Revision 12 — provider profile and stateless turn contracts

`zatiti.responses/v1`, `zatiti.responses.action/v1`, and `zatiti.responses.evidence/v1` remain immutable compatibility schemas. New profiles use `zatiti.responses/v2`; actions and evidence use `/v2`. The V2 profile requires `provider` (`openai`, `openrouter`, `experiential`) and `session_mode` (`provider_conversation`, `stateless`) and a strict provider-specific `routing` object, while retaining endpoint, model, connection, token/byte/time limits, currency, rates, enforcement and capability evidence. OpenAI uses `provider_conversation`; OpenRouter and Experiential use `stateless`. Provider and protocol revision must agree. Fixed provider endpoint presets cannot be overridden by model strings or arbitrary routing keys.

V2 action branches are discriminated by `session_mode`: conversation mode requires a nonempty provider-issued `session_handle`; stateless mode forbids both `session_handle` and `continuation_reference`. Optional `session_id` is a bounded controller-generated grouping label with no prompt or secret material. `prepare_session` exists only for conversation mode. V2 evidence carries the same mode distinction. Every adapter invocation remains exactly one physical request; unknown outcomes are never retried. V1 persisted profile/action/evidence remains decodable for replay and recovery.

Hosted `ExecutionProfile` gains optional-on-read `adapter_profile` and `connection_version`; legacy profiles remain readable but require explicit import/resolution before new hosted dispatch. Editable new profiles require both. The nested profile must agree with legacy model, connection, destination and cost fields. Immutable profile versions are retained for pending work; capability evidence binds the canonical digest of the complete adapter profile, so changing any model, route, endpoint, rate or bound invalidates it. `Action.execution_profile` is an optional exact VersionRef. Trusted `Dispatch.adapter_profile` is optional raw JSON populated only by Effects from `_configuration.execution_profile.resolve`; public callers cannot inject it. Effects persists the exact secret-free profile with the operation and returns it on claim/reconciliation, then rechecks current connection authority before send. Historical work never resolves a newer worker selection.

The controller assembly dependency struct gains a required `Context contract.ContextPerformer` field for hosted context work; it does not widen the common domain `contract.Dependencies`. The trusted context seam is `ContextPlan {ID, TurnID, ExpectedVersion, Generation, Refs []ArtifactRef, ConfigurationRevision, ByteBound, TokenBound}` and `ContextPerformer.PerformContext(ctx, plan) (json.RawMessage, error)`. Execution implements it by reading the persisted immutable recipe, building, validating and staging the complete context outside a write Unit. `_execution.context.commit` performs current-authority/generation/reference checks and publication bookkeeping. Controller receives this injected capability; there is no model-callable context IO operation.

`_execution.turn.observation` is a controller-only mutation with input `{turn_id, step_index, operation_id, observation}` and output `WorkerTurn`. It authenticates the persisted effects callback route, fences the turn generation/step and deduplicates by operation ID. Task-bound compatibility may share the logic, while task success continues to require its verifier.

`model.provider.list` is an authenticated scoped query owned by connections. It returns the fixed OpenAI/OpenRouter/Experiential IDs, display names, endpoint presets, supported session mode and API-key setup mode. It performs no catalog request. Saving uses the existing configuration draft/validate/plan/apply flow; provider credential validation is a separate bounded `connection.validate` job and does not qualify a model/route profile.

Normalized provider usage may include requested and served model IDs, serving provider, provider request ID, and exact source decimal cost evidence. Convert decimal USD to integer micro-units with checked integer/rational arithmetic and upward rounding, preserving the original decimal. No floating point is permitted. Missing, invalid or overflowing cost, disputed route, or unpriced BYOK upstream cost stays unknown/advisory; a gateway platform cost of zero is not evidence of zero upstream charge.

Revision 17 adds the internal query `_messaging.history` (caller: execution) for reconstructing a worker turn's complete chat transcript. Its worker identity is taken from the persisted turn, and Messaging verifies current conversation membership before reading sender and admitted-recipient rows. It returns up to 200 authorized rows chronologically and an explicit `complete` flag; older undisclosed or over-limit history is never silently dropped, and execution refuses provider dispatch when `complete` is false. The existing public `conversation.message.list` remains principal-scoped and unchanged. This closes the context-history gap without granting the controller or a client a history bypass.

## Owned product requirements

### R8.2-002 (source section 8.2; primary owner cli)

Every product command accepts structured input through `--input @file.json`, `--input -` for stdin, or an equivalent inline JSON option. Convenient flags may populate that same request schema. Input files are read by the CLI client, not arbitrary paths opened by the controller. `--json` emits exactly one versioned JSON result to stdout; diagnostics go to stderr. Commands do not require a TTY and never silently prompt when input is incomplete. Human rendering and optional interactive helpers use the same requests.

### R8.2-003 (source section 8.2; primary owner cli)

The exceptional capability shortcut is `zatiti capabilities --json`, mapping to `zatiti_capabilities`; the descriptor records its name explicitly. General request example:

### R8.2-004 (source section 8.2; primary owner cli)

```json
{
  "schema": "zatiti.request/v1",
  "submission_key": "demo-org-create-001",
  "input": {"key": "demo", "name": "Demo organization"}
}
```

### R8.2-005 (source section 8.2; primary owner cli)

`zatiti organization create --input @organization.json --json` and `zatiti_organization_create` with these arguments call the same handler. Creating the organization returns its draft and identity; activation follows plan/apply.

### R8.3-002 (source section 8.3; primary owner mcp)

V1 uses stdio with the generated Mint adapter (or an equivalent pinned adapter) and a pinned supported protocol revision. `zatiti mcp serve` connects to the configured local controller as the selected scoped principal. MCP stdout carries protocol frames only; diagnostic logging goes to stderr. Reconnection does not create another controller or restart tasks. A missing controller returns a named availability error; process-start convenience must not hide a second scheduler.

### R8.3-003 (source section 8.3; primary owner mcp)

The server advertises typed tools with input and output schemas. It returns the common result envelope as `structuredContent`, with equivalent serialized JSON in text content for clients that need it. Domain failures use a tool result with `isError: true`; malformed protocol messages use protocol errors. Zatiti specifies this mapping against the [MCP tools contract](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/server/tools).

### R8.3-004 (source section 8.3; primary owner mcp)

Do not require optional client features such as sampling, elicitation, resources, prompts, or protocol-level task extensions for baseline product access. Long work uses Zatiti task/command IDs and polling. Local stdio is the first-release transport; remote HTTP requires a separate authentication and exposure design before support. See the [MCP transport specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/transports) and [official Go SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk).

### P00-013 (source section P00; primary owner cli)

Descriptor.CLI is the subcommand path only and excludes the binary name; cmd/zatiti prepends `zatiti` exactly once at command-tree assembly. Generated AGENTS.md prose showing the full invocation (for example "CLI `zatiti artifact export`") is a rendering convenience for readability, not part of the wire contract, and must never be read as though the printed binary name were part of Descriptor.CLI itself.

### R-MAC9-002 (source section MAC9; primary owner zatiti)

An installed signed Mac GUI credential helper in the controller distribution captures a bounded provider key through AppKit without passing raw bytes through Dart, argv, environment or any public operation. The signed Runner sends only installation and connection IDs and receives a redacted status; the helper owns the protected Keychain and trusted challenge/store-reference/receipt flow. Setup mutations use durable submission keys and command/status reconciliation; a protected pending intent prevents silent duplicate challenges or orphaned credential refs after a lost acknowledgement or crash. Missing master-key/owner access and locked or refused Keychain fail closed. A real provider first reply and all required Serenity protocol, writer, memory, accounting, reconciliation and backup guarantees remain mandatory release gates.

### R-MAC9-003 (source section MAC9; primary owner distribution)

The one-line Mac command is generated only after the hosted bootstrap script has a literal SHA-256 in the command. That script verifies a literal hash of the signed/notarized universal bootstrap app archive before extracting and launching its fixed executable. The bootstrap app embeds the trusted delivery-signature public keys and hardware-architecture detection, then consumes the six-asset signed delivery record through RunMacBootstrap. Neither an unsigned curl-pipe-shell stage nor a fetched trust key establishes trust. Real Team ID, hosting URL, notarization and clean-host evidence are external gates; no public command is claimed from fixture tests.

### R-MAC10-001 (source section MAC10; primary owner distribution)

Mac bootstrap activation is a locked ordered chain: prove signed package bytes and Apple trust, run the fixed per-user installer, verify the installed three-file inbox against the signed plan, create or validate the fixed login-Keychain master item without rotation, activate through Apply, audit the active controller and desktop trees, helper and LaunchAgent, then advance the protected release fence. Existing-release and crash recovery require the same authoritative active-tree audit; package receipts and inert inbox bytes are insufficient. Packaging owns narrow injected interfaces and imports no platform code; cmd/zatiti composes the platform provisioner.

### R-MAC10-002 (source section MAC10; primary owner zatiti)

A protected credential-helper recovery intent retains only bounded nonsecret replay identities, account and credential name, opaque store reference, challenge version/expiry, stable begin and complete submission keys, and an exact request digest or request bytes persisted before each mutation call. A retry reconstructs byte-identical input under the same key or refuses; phase-dependent fields are validated and provider/owner/HMAC secret bytes are absent.

### R-MAC10-003 (source section MAC10; primary owner qualification)

Each native Mac release report must prove one linked clean-host install-to-first-chat journey on its architecture, binding the same signed delivery, literal script and universal bootstrap hashes to its architecture-specific package, component and helper hashes, installed-inbox and active-tree audits, fixed launcher and Keychain readiness, genuine provider response readback and full Serenity capability evidence. The Intel and Apple Silicon reports use distinct host-run IDs, agree on shared release identity, and both pass the linked named case; absent, skipped, synthetic or independently assembled evidence blocks release.

### R-MAC11-001 (source section MAC11; primary owner connections)

Mac setup signs the personal chief into the existing hosted Serenity personal brain through system-browser OAuth with explicit project and read/write consent. A trusted installed helper owns PKCE, exact loopback callback, token exchange and secure token custody; a public authenticated binding read verifies issuer, resource, account, selected project, scopes and grant before connection activation. Zatiti maps its local UUID brain to the verified hosted project ID without duplicating memory or granting other workers inherited access. Lost responses, denial, refresh/revocation and account/project changes reconcile or fail closed; tokens and codes never enter Dart, model context, public operations, argv or logs.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"expected_version":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":9223372036854775807},"reason":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192}},"required":["scope","id","expected_version","reason"]}

### `task.start` v1 — tasks / public / mutation / local

CLI `zatiti task start`; MCP `zatiti_task_start`. Submission key: required.

Transition an eligible draft/ready task to ready and enqueue its run in the same transaction; existing draft-only task.create stays compatible and task.assign continues to only change worker/version without readying.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"expected_version":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":9223372036854775807}},"required":["scope","id","expected_version"]}

### `worker.list` v1 — configuration / public / query / local

CLI `zatiti worker list`; MCP `zatiti_worker_list`. Submission key: not required at this internal/query/bootstrap boundary.

Read an authorized consistent snapshot. Apply scope and filter before pagination. Cursor binds principal and query. Filters are structured exact-match fields (AND semantics); unsupported fields for this resource refuse invalid_input. Never interpolate filter strings as SQL.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"cursor":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"limit":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":200},"filter":{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"state":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"key":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"parent_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"worker_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"task_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"organization_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"descendants":{"type":"boolean"},"needs_you":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":[]}},"required":["scope"]}

```

### `worker.pause` v1 — execution / public / mutation / local

CLI `zatiti worker pause`; MCP `zatiti_worker_pause`. Submission key: required.

Pause immediately blocks new worker admissions without inference or spending; resume requires current normal authority. Existing external effects remain visible.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"expected_version":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":9223372036854775807}},"required":["scope","id","expected_version"]}

```

### Local schema definitions

The schemas above resolve exclusively against this embedded `$defs` object. Input objects reject additional properties except explicitly open schema/data fields. Field semantics are completed by the owned requirements and operation descriptions. Output `resource`, `items`, `draft`, `job`, etc. are literal keys. Pagination cursor lives in the common envelope.

## Local adapter, context, verifier and backup payloads

These local schemas freeze the handoff between execution, adapters and artifact publication. They do not assert upstream compatibility.

These are exact Zatiti-side contracts, not representations of upstream APIs. Adapter implementation translates to a pinned, separately qualified public upstream protocol; unsupported semantics fail capability_unsupported or preserve outcome_unknown.
To validate a named schema, place definitions under the root $defs and reference the selected name. The catalog container uses definitions for packaging only; every embedded #/$defs/Name resolves against that assembled validation document. JSON Schema dialect is 2020-12.
Validate strict objects, formats, explicit field limits, duplicate-key rejection and exact integer bounds. Runtime must also enforce total JSON/artifact byte limits, at most 64 JSON levels and 100000 schema/input nodes; schema documents and dynamic tool arguments cannot escape the qualified local validation dialect.
Opaque references, URLs, headers and diagnostics must never contain secret bytes. Profile configuration is trusted local configuration; public operation arguments cannot install profiles, select a more privileged credential, open an arbitrary server path or replace capability evidence.
Before dispatch, profile capability evidence must match the canonical profile digest computed with the capability_evidence field omitted; self-referential capability evidence and qualification records do not grant authority. The binding/effect owner independently checks current account, scope, destinations, classification, prices and qualified capability.
PhysicalCallEvidence records exactly one physical network request per claimed attempt. request_context is an ArtifactLocator that identifies the pre-dispatch persisted request. An adapter receives no IDSource and BlobStore mints no artifact identity, so an adapter never fabricates an ArtifactRef and never reuses capability_evidence or any other unrelated artifact as a stand-in. Before writing any request bytes, the adapter stages the exact bounded request record (method, destination, permitted headers and body as sent, with credentials and every secret excluded) through BlobStore.Stage and returns request_context as kind staged with that staging_ref and digest, plus exactly one matching StagedOutput with purpose context in the same observation. If staging fails, the adapter sends nothing. Kind artifact is allowed at adapter return only to pass through, unchanged, a published ArtifactRef received in Dispatch.Action whose bytes already are the complete request record, for example ResponsesParameters.context_artifact when the translated provider request adds nothing model-visible beyond the persisted Action. ModelOutput.request_context equals physical_call.request_context. Reconcile is its own physical call with its own request_context. A not_sent, failed or unknown attempt keeps its staged request context. No adapter adds preflight, redirect, polling, SDK retry or model tool execution inside that request; each such external action requires a separate governed attempt.
StagedOutput is an IO handoff, not a published ArtifactRef. Adapter stages bytes and returns staging_ref/digest metadata; controller uses the artifacts owner to publish metadata and replace staged locators with real ArtifactRefs before delivering normalized observations to execution/memory/other domains. output_artifacts may be empty at adapter return and contains the resulting published refs in recorded domain evidence. ArtifactLocator staged references, including physical_call.request_context and ModelOutput.request_context, must match exactly one StagedOutput in the same observation. The controller is responsible for publishing the staged request context with every other StagedOutput and for replacing the staged locator with kind artifact and the published ArtifactRef in the normalized evidence it delivers; the raw recorded adapter observation is not rewritten. Owners receiving normalized evidence accept only kind artifact for request_context and treat a staged locator there as an unpublished obligation, not success. HTTPReadEvidence therefore allows two staged outputs and two output artifacts: the request context and at most one response body. Failed publication remains a visible obligation/fault.
ContextArtifact.messages and each parts array preserve the exact model-visible semantic order. Tool definitions, memory excerpts and injected messages must all appear in the persisted request context before dispatch. Context source artifacts and compaction lineage do not replace retaining the actual selected text. Complete capture is required for owned hosted loops; external capture limitations remain explicit.
Model tool proposals are observations. tool ID/version must match the pinned context tool closure; operation ID/version must be the qualified mapping for that tool. Validate input against that exact schema and apply current authority/review/budgets before a separate operation. Never execute a model proposal directly in an adapter.
Responses input_rate.unit must equal input_token and output_rate.unit output_token; profile currencies and all reported/reserved usage must agree. Round admission reservations upward using checked integer rational arithmetic. Missing or unbounded required charges refuse hard-cap mode. A null/absent upstream usage report maps to unknown/advisory billing, never free success.
GitHubParameters is discriminated by kind. read_repository requires branch for ref, sha for commit/tree/blob, and pull_request_number for pull_request; irrelevant resource selectors are rejected. Relative repository paths and branch syntax receive Git-aware validation. Profile allowed_actions must be separately qualified against real API preconditions and downstream automation.
GitHub push_commit publishes an already prepared exact commit SHA in one qualified physical request. Creating remote blobs, trees or commits is not hidden inside Invoke: it needs an explicit separately admitted decomposition and qualification before enabling that route. Preflight evidence cannot substitute for atomic provider preconditions where the action requires protection against a race; refuse unsupported guarantees.
GitHub open_pull_request and merge_pull_request are consequential effects bound to exact account/repository/head/base/content/timing/automation constraints. A successful HTTP response or accepted request is not independently assumed confirmed completion; response interpretation follows the qualified contract. Eventual not-found never proves nonexecution.
HTTPRead v1 max_redirects is exactly zero. Return redirect_location as evidence/prerequisite and require a separately authorized read for the new URL. Validate DNS results and bind validated dial addresses; reject local/private/link-local/metadata targets unless explicitly permitted by an installation-authorized destination binding. Header values reject controls and duplicate header names; Authorization, Cookie and arbitrary raw credential input are excluded.
Serenity profile endpoints/root_ref/writer_owner are opaque locally provisioned mappings, not model-selectable arbitrary filesystem locations. They identify real pinned public protocol/read-facade support. Zatiti never imports upstream internal packages or invents public endpoints from these local operation names.
Serenity recall/remember/promote may incur disclosure or charges. All nested upstream provider destinations and spend must fit enforcement; unsupported enforceable bounds disable the mode or require explicitly permitted advisory use. Promote resolves and authorizes source content before preparing the destination write and retains the source evidence; it does not perform an unaccounted extra source read inside Invoke.
Serenity adapter_command_id is the durable pre-dispatch command identity. Its existence does not prove upstream idempotency: reconcile through qualified status semantics, retaining unknown after lost acknowledgement if authoritative lookup is unavailable. One writer owner per brain. Retract removes active recall and leaves historical_erasure false; promotion correction lineage remains a durable memory-owner obligation.
Verification profiles are installation-owned and pinned before task execution. command_id, runner_profile and environment_profile resolve only to prequalified local verifiers; no request supplies executable paths or argv. ArtifactVerifierProfile runs presence/digest/schema checks; RepositoryVerifierProfile runs the pinned controlled patch/check profile outside Unit. A worker cannot alter profile bytes, accepted inputs or result authority.
VerificationResult.independent=true is necessary structure, not trust evidence: only the trusted runner may submit that result through its internal admission identity. Match task/attempt, acceptance digest, verifier identity/version/digest and request artifact before accepting. Passed requires all sealed expected checks observed as required; unavailable, interrupted, worker assertion and process exit zero alone cannot succeed a task. Manual acceptance uses the separate task operation and never fabricates an independent result.
BackupManifest is inside an authenticated encrypted bundle; it never includes decrypting master keys. archive_entry values are normalized relative entries with no traversal, absolute paths, symlinks, duplicate/case collisions or devices. Verify database/artifact/brain digests and qualified revision exports before marking backup verified. Large manifests stream through bounded artifact IO, not public JSON request bodies.
Restore starts paused under exclusive maintenance, validates installation binding and key prerequisites, and retains current recovery overlay before rewinding. Merge revocations, durable command identities, claimed/unknown effects, reservations and memory obligations monotonically via their owners; fail closed on conflict and retain the overlay. Overlay record artifacts must be included/pinned and encrypted. No database/brain rewind is represented as undoing an external effect.
Revision 3 splits ResponsesParameters/ResponsesEvidence by the kind discriminator into prepare_session (creates the provider conversation, returns session_handle, no model-visible content and no context_artifact) and model_step (names the persisted session_handle and sends context_artifact/max_output_tokens/tool_contract_versions). Each is exactly one physical call per Invoke; the adapter never performs both requests inside one Invoke. A prepare_session timeout after the request was sent leaves the session unknown, not absent, and must not be resent; a model_step timeout after bytes were sent is outcome_unknown and an empty item list is equally consistent with never ran and still running, so nonexecution is never assumed and no automatic fresh call follows.

## Named acceptance cases

Tests are implementation deliverables, not claims of already executed qualification. Retain expected/observed results, exact source/config/tool versions and failure evidence.

### QUALIFICATION.macos_gui_secret_helper — QUALIFICATION

Setup: Install the signed architecture-matched controller helper and Flutter Runner with a provisioned default login Keychain on clean Intel and Apple Silicon accounts; use synthetic credentials until explicit live-provider qualification.

Action: Capture, cancel, lock/refuse Keychain, invoke helper from an unsigned/other-team parent, lose setup.begin and setup.complete responses, crash after SecretStore.Put, then upgrade and reopen the app. Inspect argv/environment/channel/log/public-operation bytes.

Expected:

- Dart, argv, environment, output, logs and public operation inputs contain no raw provider key; native request/result fields are strictly bounded and redacted.
- Only the signed Runner launches the declared helper; wrong caller/signature, missing master item, locked Keychain and stale installation identity fail closed without plaintext fallback.
- Durable submission keys and challenge/connection status reconcile lost acknowledgements; the effective credential is retained, a stale orphan is removed only after authoritative check, and no second challenge/key is silently minted.
- Real signed GUI and Keychain ACL continuity pass separately on both native architectures; fake UI/store tests alone are not qualification.

### QUALIFICATION.macos_bootstrap_entrypoint — QUALIFICATION

Setup: Build and host final script plus signed/notarized universal bootstrap app using external trusted signing inputs, then publish a literal command pinned to the exact script SHA on a reviewed release page.

Action: On clean native Intel and Apple Silicon hosts without developer tools, run the literal command, tamper each script/app archive hash and signature, attempt redirect and Rosetta execution, and inspect the selected signed delivery assets.

Expected:

- The command never executes network script bytes before verifying its literal SHA; the script verifies a separately pinned bootstrap app archive and exact code-signing/notarization identity before launch.
- The bootstrap app embeds trusted Ed25519 roots, never adopts a fetched key, detects native hardware under Rosetta and downloads only the matching controller/desktop/pkg assets.
- Actual hosted bytes, URL, command hash, Team ID, OS/arch and installer evidence are recorded; any missing artifact or failed clean-host run blocks the advertised one-line installation claim.

### QUALIFICATION.macos_install_to_first_chat — QUALIFICATION

Setup: Prepare the final signed release delivery, literal bootstrap script and universal app, both architecture-specific signed packages and a clean native Intel or Apple Silicon account without developer tools; provide qualified live provider and full public Serenity capabilities.

Action: On each native host run the exact one-line command, verify installed inbox and active tree/launcher/master Keychain against the same signed bytes, sign in to hosted Serenity through the system browser and verify the selected existing personal brain, capture a provider credential in the signed helper, send the first chief chat, and read the response and Serenity effects back from authoritative controller state. Repeat on the other native architecture and aggregate the two redacted host reports.

Expected:

- Each host records a unique host-run ID, native OS build, fixed installer invocation, actual signer Team ID/certificate, descriptor/delivery/script/universal-bootstrap digests and that host's package/controller/desktop/helper digests, with no credential or raw model text.
- The same run links package payload and installed inbox checks, retained master key, active trees/LaunchAgent, verified hosted OAuth account/project/scopes, real provider response readback and every full Serenity writer, memory, reconciliation, cost/disclosure and backup-revision guarantee; a synthetic or independent case cannot substitute.
- Both native reports agree on shared release identity and hashes, differ by host-run ID, and pass the linked case. Missing fields, Rosetta, skipped/not-run cases, no installed artifact, or unavailable upstream guarantee blocks the first-chat release and public one-line command.

### QUALIFICATION.macos_hosted_serenity_oauth — QUALIFICATION

Setup: A clean installed Mac account has access to an already populated hosted Serenity personal project and an installed signed Zatiti helper.

Action: Sign in through the system browser, select that project and read/write consent, complete the exact loopback callback, verify bearer-bound account/project/scopes, recall an existing fact, write and read back a new fact, then revoke/reconnect and exercise denied, expired, wrong-project and ambiguous-refresh cases.

Expected:

- No code/token/verifier reaches Dart, argv, public operations, logs or model context; the trusted connection records only observed grant metadata and a protected credential reference.
- The personal chief uses the selected pre-existing hosted brain, while unrelated scopes cannot read it; revocation and account/project substitution fail closed.
- Real hosted capability, command-status, spend/disclosure and immutable backup-revision evidence is required before the first-chat gate passes.

## Delivery

Implement production behavior and meaningful local tests within scope. Report files changed, commands actually run, observed results, unresolved dependency qualifications and contract defects. A missing dependency may use an exact local fake for development; production must return a named prerequisite/unsupported error instead of fake success. Integration owns shared dependency changes, real assembly, cross-package proving and landing. Do not advertise release or client/platform support from compilation alone.
