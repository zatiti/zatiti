# Roadmap

RFC implementation status (docs/rfc.md). Integration lead: the `zatiti`
session; packages land only through its gate (build, vet, lint, stub scan,
tests, race under lease, mutation red→green, rebase, ff-merge).

## Shipped

- 2026-09-10 — wave 1 complete: contract, storage, platform, client,
  identity, registry, application, configuration (all merged to main;
  module-wide `go test ./...` green at configuration landing).
- 2026-09-10 — registry re-landed in wave 2 (f5657e8), application
  (ab71c8b), configuration (1488db3), skills (169e5be), tasks (8cda814),
  reviews (b1516e2), policy (4051f67). Integration notes:
  docs/implementation/integration-notes.md.
- 2026-09-11 — scheduling landed (3e6f665) and connections landed
  (90f676a): both races green under lease, integration mutations proved
  the scope fences load-bearing (scheduling scopeContains org dimension;
  connections scopeCovers org dimension), module-wide 14-package verify
  green post-merge, worktrees removed.

## In progress
- 2026-09-11 — accounting: 23 files verified + mutation done by the lane
  agent; race + commit running in its lease lane; then integration gate.
- 2026-09-11 — messaging: agent implementing (zatiti_messaging) in
  zatiti-wt-messaging.

## Planned

- Wave 2 top-up (staggered as slots free): execution, effects, memory,
  artifacts, evidence, installation, server, cli, mcp, adapters/github,
  adapters/httpread.
- Wave 3: controller, desktop, cmd/zatiti, cmd/zatiti-desktop.
- Wave 4: tests/integration, tests/qualification, packaging,
  .github/workflows.

## Blocked

- 2026-09-10 — internal/adapters/responses and internal/adapters/serenity:
  external endpoints not resolved per docs/implementation/dependencies.lock.json.
- 2026-09-10 — OpenRouter key 403 resolved: the earlier weekly-limit deaths
  did not recur; the two resume lanes (connections, accounting) completed
  full cycles past the previous death window, and fresh dispatches
  (messaging) are running. No top-up needed unless a fresh 403 appears.
