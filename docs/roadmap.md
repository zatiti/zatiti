# Roadmap

RFC implementation status (docs/rfc.md). Integration lead: the `zatiti`
session; packages land only through its gate (build, vet, lint, stub scan,
tests, race under lease, mutation red→green, rebase, ff-merge).

## Shipped

- 2026-09-10 — wave 1 complete: contract, storage, platform, client,
  identity, registry, application, configuration (all merged to main;
  module-wide `go test ./...` green at configuration landing).
- 2026-09-10 — registry re-landed in wave 2 (f5657e8), application
  (ab71c8b), configuration (1488db3), skills (169e5be), tasks (8cda814),
  reviews (b1516e2), policy (4051f67). Integration notes:
  docs/implementation/integration-notes.md.
- 2026-09-11 — scheduling landed (3e6f665) and connections landed
  (90f676a): both races green under lease, integration mutations proved
  the scope fences load-bearing (scheduling scopeContains org dimension;
  connections scopeCovers org dimension), module-wide 14-package verify
  green post-merge, worktrees removed.
- 2026-09-11 — messaging landed (f09bbe9): integration mutation proved
  the conversation.create caller-participation fence load-bearing; lane
  agent's mutation covered the mailbox.ack principal fence; 46 behavioral
  tests; two suite-forced production fixes (event scope stamping from the
  unit, fresh-delivery recipient hydration). Worktree removed.
- 2026-09-11 — accounting landed (bc7f58d): wave 2 is 16 of 37 packages.
  Integration mutation proved the settle terminal-replay fence
  load-bearing (a settled reservation with a different usage report would
  otherwise replay as if identical — history rewrite). Module-wide
  16-package verify green post-merge.

## In progress
- 2026-09-11 — wave-2 tail (10 packages): execution and effects
  dispatching now; memory, artifacts, evidence, installation, server,
  cli, mcp, adapters/github, adapters/httpread staggered behind them.

## Planned

- Wave 3: controller, desktop, cmd/zatiti, cmd/zatiti-desktop.
- Wave 3: controller, desktop, cmd/zatiti, cmd/zatiti-desktop.
- Wave 4: tests/integration, tests/qualification, packaging,
  .github/workflows.

## Blocked

- 2026-09-10 — internal/adapters/responses and internal/adapters/serenity:
  external endpoints not resolved per docs/implementation/dependencies.lock.json.
- 2026-09-10 — OpenRouter key 403 resolved: the earlier weekly-limit deaths
  did not recur; the two resume lanes (connections, accounting) completed
  full cycles past the previous death window, and fresh dispatches
  (messaging) are running. No top-up needed unless a fresh 403 appears.
