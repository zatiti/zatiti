# Implementation assignment: `internal/execution`

Generated specification revision 1; source digest `c79b39e5ca496cd59114fdaa2c9dd3a36d7c9c0d3b4426bc131063f5cef22ca2`. This file is committed implementation context. Do not independently edit it. Everything required from the product specification and adjacent interfaces is embedded below; no RFC copy is required.

## Mission and scope

Own runs, executor attempts, leases, hosted loop context, cooperative protocol and verification coordination.

Write scope: **`internal/execution/` only**, excluding this generated AGENTS.md. Go package name: `execution`. Ownership kind: domain; integration wave: 2.

Allowed production imports from this repository: `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/contract`. Tests may use interfaces/fakes defined locally and, once available, storage-backed temporary fixtures; integration owns cross-package tests. No sibling raw SQL. No root dependency edits except the integration exception stated in its own brief.

## Implementation decisions and acceptance focus

Own execution_runs/attempts/leases/checkpoints/context_lineage/verification_jobs. Run pins effective configuration and task inputs; attempt owns executor/lease/generation/reservation/output disposition. Concurrent claim must choose one current owner, replay lost ack returns same lease. Default heartbeat interval 15s, lease 60s capped by deadline; no revival after expiry/generation change. Stale lease fences Zatiti mutation but does not prove external process death; replacement blocks on explicit conflicting-resource/effect recovery. Hosted loop uses responses adapter only through effects; store all model-visible user messages/tools/results/memory/instructions/agent messages before dispatch. Compaction persists source lineage and actual compacted context artifact. Parse model tool proposals as untrusted typed requests and authorize through effects. Limits apply each step including continuation/evaluation. Cooperative claims return pinned task/context/bindings/capabilities and advisory usage disclaimer, never dispatch credential or owner secrets. Reports bind exact worker/attempt/lease/generation; independent verifier controls task completion. V1 verifier runner executes only accepted pinned verifier profiles in controlled environment, captures observations/artifact hashes, and cannot be replaced by reported worker checks. Cancellation requests owned-loop interrupt and retains unknown physical effects. Own attempt admission counter and release only safe concurrency resources; uncertain cost reservation stays in accounting.

Local proving focus: Concurrent claims/lost ack, heartbeat/lease expiry/generation restart, fenced report, owned context reconstruction/compaction, safe replacement, bounded model steps, independent verification, advisory external worker limits.

## Incoming and outgoing boundaries

Incoming callers: application, artifacts, configuration, connections, controller, effects, execution, installation, memory, scheduling, skills, tasks, application (authenticated public operations).

Outgoing owner calls: `_identity.authority`, `_configuration.snapshot`, `_policy.check`, `_policy.invalidate`, `_accounting.reserve`, `_accounting.settle`, `_accounting.inspect`, `_connections.resolve`, `_tasks.create`, `_tasks.snapshot`, `_tasks.transition`, `_scheduling.cycle.record`, `_effects.admit`, `_effects.prepare`, `_messaging.admit`, `_messaging.pending`, `_memory.select`, `_artifacts.metadata`, `_artifacts.publish`, `_tasks.ready`. Each exact input/output schema appears below. Calls retain current Unit/authority; owner allowlists are mandatory.

Expose `New(contract.Dependencies) (*Service,error)`; `*Service` implements `contract.Module` with Name `execution`, owner-prefixed migrations, all owned descriptors, and strict dispatch. No calls/goroutines during construction. Implement optional authentication/LocalIO interfaces where specified in the common contract. Tables are private under `execution_`; external callers rely only on methods and schemas.

### Imported package APIs and behavior

These briefs are embedded so you need not read a sibling prompt to discover its incoming API. Implement only your own package.

## Shared foundation contract

# Frozen implementation contract, revision 1

These decisions complete the product specification and bind every scope. Report contradictions with an affected-dependency list and proposed coordinated revision; do not change another owner's interface locally.

## Build and dependency decisions

Module `github.com/zatiti/zatiti`; language `go 1.26.0`; initial toolchain `go1.26.2`. Integration owns go.mod/go.sum. Domains import standard library and internal/contract, not sibling domains. Application composes owner methods through a checked in-process dispatcher: ordinary Go calls, not another server or scheduler.

Library families: Cobra CLI; official MCP Go SDK, handwritten adapter for MCP `2025-11-25`; Fyne v2 native Go desktop; modernc.org/sqlite. Mint is optional build-time tooling and cannot weaken contracts. Hosted provider v1: a specifically qualified OpenAI Responses endpoint/profile, with configured model and prices. Other compatible endpoints remain unavailable until qualified. GitHub uses documented REST over net/http, with mutation retries disabled. Serenity is a separate pinned service using public interfaces only. Integration must resolve exact dependency releases/commits, checksums, licenses and qualification commands in a lock report BEFORE dispatching dependent implementation. These are selected implementation families, not claims that upstream behavior has been qualified. No agent independently substitutes libraries, models, prices, accounts or Serenity APIs. Dependency resolution/qualification is an explicit foundation assignment.

## Shared Go declarations

The contract owner implements these exact declarations. Omitted function bodies are the implementation assignment, not production stubs. Public JSON uses snake_case. Schema-derived DTO names concatenate operation path segments in PascalCase plus Input/Output and live in the owning package. JSON integer => int64, UUID => contract.ID, timestamp => time.Time, optional scalar => pointer, array => slice, explicitly open JSON => json.RawMessage. Unknown fields are rejected.

The registry binds concrete input/output DTO types to descriptors and handlers using `Bind[I, O any](descriptor contract.Descriptor, fn func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. JSON decoding is strict and schema validation precedes execution. Internal cross-owner calls use the same schema-checked Invocation boundary to avoid sibling package imports. They retain the same Unit, actor, scope, generation and transaction; cannot mint authority; and are not exposed as public operations.

## Transaction and ownership rules

Each domain owns tables prefixed with its package name and `_`. Schema and migration bodies inside that namespace are package-private; no other package depends on their layout. Storage owns installation generation, migration metadata and `storage_events`. Evidence owns commands/receipts. Migration ordering is explicit in application assembly. All migrations run under exclusive installation ownership before serving. Cross-owner reads and changes use Ports.Call and the embedded internal schemas. Internal operations have a caller allowlist. The dispatcher detects recursive calls. Queries cannot invoke mutation descriptors. Public clients cannot supply Actor or Unit or invoke internal operations.

One controller, one ordered writer, WAL, foreign keys on every connection, synchronous FULL, busy timeout 5 seconds, consistent read snapshots. Database.Write performs ONE transaction callback attempt with no automatic callback retry. Busy exhaustion returns controller_unavailable/retryable. Unit is valid only inside its callback; no goroutines or retained handles. Unit.Emit appends state-correlated evidence to the storage outbox in the same transaction. Delivery is at least once and consumers deduplicate event IDs. No network/model calls, secret-store access, filesystem streaming or subprocess work inside a Unit. Stage bytes or local helper actions outside transactions, then publish metadata or reconciliation intent through owner methods.

Handler errors roll back the entire transaction. Persist a command refusal in a separate short transaction after rollback where necessary, retaining the original request identity. Query command IDs need not be durable. All mutations return durable command IDs; accepted responses must identify inspectable durable work. Output schemas describe Payload.Data, not the result envelope. Never leak SQL, tokens, provider raw responses or private paths through Fault.

Definition creates/updates/archive stage drafts, including schedules, responsibilities, policies and memory bindings. Only configuration.apply activates definitions. It validates owners' candidate slices, seals base revision/dependencies/requirements, and calls internal activate in the same transaction under old authority. Internal activate is admitted only from the compiler during exact plan application, not by a public flag. Public restrictive pause/revoke/cancel commits immediately without compilation or spending. Archive staging may immediately disable new admissions as an explicitly reported restrictive side effect; final removal waits for obligations.

## Effect and execution rules

Admit: current authorization, exact review/preconditions, all budget reservations, attempt/dispatch intent and evidence atomically. Claim: second transaction rechecks generation/restrictions/expiry and consumes the one-use claim. Invoke the adapter outside transactions. Record: third transaction stores observations, costs or retained uncertainty and events. Each physical call, including reconciliation and retries, has a distinct attempt. Reconciliation is an admitted bounded read and links to the original effect; it does not overwrite history. Internal jobs use explicitly provisioned scoped service identities plus current worker/task restrictions.

Once claimed, crash/timeout/cancel/lease expiry/operator acknowledgement/weak not-found cannot prove nonexecution. Preserve outcome_unknown and its reservation until authoritative evidence. Earlier unknown attempts survive later failures. Mutation SDK/HTTP retries are disabled. Even qualified idempotent retries need fresh authorization and physical-attempt evidence. Trusted adapters resolve credential references outside transactions; no public raw secrets or inherited owner credential environment. Fencing external workers blocks Zatiti mutations but cannot prove their processes stopped.

Task success needs independently established acceptance against pinned verifier code/version, sealed inputs and observations. Worker report/exit zero cannot set succeeded. Defaults: one concurrent attempt/worker, four/installation, 30 minutes/attempt, 100 model steps, eight children, delegation depth three, root deadline 24 hours. Configure explicit currency and finite spend limits before paid work. Amounts are int64 micro-units with checked overflow; rational rates use integer numerator/denominator and round reservations upward. Unknown/advisory usage and missing prices are not zero. Children share root and ancestor budgets.

## Wire conventions and limits

UUIDv4 for new identities; stable UUID references thereafter. SHA-256 lowercase hex digests. Versioned canonical JSON sorts keys, rejects duplicate keys/unknown fields, preserves exact integer values and semantic array order; schema-declared sets sort by stable identity. Preserve exact skill bytes. UTC RFC3339Nano timestamps and int64 versions >=1. Patches and snapshots are distinct; explicit delete only. Inert `extensions` alone permits namespaced extra keys. Scope is explicit and every referenced object is revalidated; no implicit global organization.

Default limits: JSON request 1 MiB; chunk 1 MiB decoded; artifact 256 MiB; skill archive 16 MiB compressed, 64 MiB expanded, 4096 entries, depth 32; list 50/max 200; read 1 MiB; redacted log record 8 KiB; event page 100/max 500; upload expiry 24 hours. Narrowing is allowed, increases require authorized configuration. Reject overflow and unsupported bounds.

Mutations require submission_key (1..128 printable ASCII) except one-time init. Bind principal, operation/version and canonical input hash. Retain >=30 days and through unresolved obligations. Replay identical input returns original disposition BEFORE stale-version validation; changed input => submission_conflict. Concurrent duplicates serialize. Recover lost acknowledgements by command lookup, not a new key. Resource updates require expected_version; apply requires base_revision and plan digest. Creation has no existing version. Opaque authenticated cursors bind principal/scope/filter/order/snapshot and expire explicitly with cursor_expired and snapshot_required=true. Event replay cannot silently omit a gap.

HTTP POST `/v1/operations/{operation_id}` uses the common request envelope. Local HTTP runs over a private Unix socket. Explicit remote desktop uses mutual TLS mapped to current application principals over the same operation contract, never remote MCP. Completed => HTTP 200; accepted => 202. Failed mapping: invalid_input 400, permission_denied 403, not_found 404, stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict/review_required/outcome_unknown/artifact_fault 409, cursor_expired 410, prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported/verification_failed 422, controller_unavailable 503, internal_error 500. Domain failures always include the result envelope.

CLI completed/accepted => exit 0; invalid_input 2; permission_denied/review_required 3; stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict 4; prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported 5; controller_unavailable/outcome_unknown 6; other failures 1. CLI --json emits one envelope to stdout, diagnostics stderr, no implicit prompts. MCP structuredContent is the full envelope, text is equivalent JSON, failed => isError true, malformed protocol => protocol error. Dot-separated operation IDs map to CLI tokens and `zatiti_` MCP names. Exceptions: installation.init => `zatiti init` / `zatiti_installation_init`; capabilities.list => `zatiti capabilities` / `zatiti_capabilities`. Lifecycle steps are individual tools. Tool input never selects a credential profile or accepts raw secrets/unrestricted server paths.

## Completion policy

Write only within the assigned root. Do not edit this prompt, siblings, shared contracts, root dependencies or external acceptance inputs. Implement exact fake dependencies locally; do not return invented production success for unavailable prerequisites. Use controlled providers, deterministic clocks and synthetic fixtures. Preserve expected/observed results and failure evidence. Package tests prove local properties; actual subprocess parity, crash recovery, desktop and adapter qualification prove integration. Z01-Z21 and first-release journeys on macOS/Linux must pass before a release is claimed.

## Local IO, authentication, jobs and verification seams

These additional declarations are part of the SAME frozen contract package (using imports already shown). Implementing an interface does not permit calling it inside a Unit except where the signature explicitly takes Unit/Reader.

```go
type Authenticator interface {
    Authenticate(context.Context, Reader, []byte) (Actor, error)
    AuthenticateCertificate(context.Context, Reader, Digest) (Actor, error)
}
type IOPlan struct {
    ID ID
    Owner string
    Invocation Invocation
    Actor Actor
    Scope Scope
    Generation int64
    ExpectedVersions map[ID]Version
    Prepared json.RawMessage
}
type IOResult struct { Data json.RawMessage; Fault *Fault }
type LocalIO interface {
    Prepare(context.Context, Unit, Invocation) (IOPlan, error)
    Perform(context.Context, IOPlan) (IOResult, error)
    Finish(context.Context, Unit, IOPlan, IOResult) (Payload, error)
}
// Request is the exact VerificationRequest JSON schema embedded in the prompt.
type Verification struct { Request json.RawMessage }
// Document is the exact VerificationResult schema, including independently
// observed checks, pinned identity, task/attempt and staged artifact handoff.
type VerificationResult struct { Document json.RawMessage }
type Verifier interface {
    Verify(context.Context, Verification) (VerificationResult, error)
}
type VerifierDependencies struct { Clock Clock; Blobs BlobStore }
```

Identity Service also implements Authenticator. Application receives this interface explicitly in New; it uses a dedicated read snapshot and never reads identity-owned tables itself. Only the byte-slice credential boundary carries secret authentication material, never Invocation JSON. Zero sensitive buffers after use where practical; no logging. Certificate authentication resolves a preprovisioned credential reference and follows the same current principal/revocation rules.

Artifacts, skills, connections and installation Services also implement LocalIO. The registry detects this interface at assembly and routes ONLY registered local IO operations through Prepare/Perform/Finish: artifact.upload.chunk/finish/cancel/read/export; skill.import; connection.setup.begin/complete/cancel; installation.init/backup/restore. LocalIO handles local bounded files, secure helpers and backup work, never unadmitted provider/model calls. Prepare strictly validates input, versions, identity and authority and records replayable local intent under IOPlan.ID; Perform receives that exact trusted in-memory plan outside transactions, resolves opaque staging/helper references, and returns metadata; Finish rechecks authority/versions/generation and commits result/evidence. IOPlan is never public, accepted from an agent or stored with secrets. Prepared/Data JSON must use the operation's declared schemas plus private owner-local metadata, which no other package reads. No cross-owner business protocol may hide in those private fields. Perform must support safe replay of local staging/publication by plan ID, or preserve an inspectable failed/unknown local obligation. A synchronous read does not return bytes to client until final authorization check. New raw provider writes always use effects, not this interface.

For synchronous local IO mutations, persist command identity plus accepted internal pending disposition at Prepare, then replace pending disposition once at Finish. Concurrent same-key calls join/inspect that same in-progress command and never run duplicate Perform. The controller can recover abandoned local intents using the execution job API. Async backup/export uses the same interface with an inspectable job returned immediately. The artifact.upload.chunk endpoint has a 2 MiB encoded request cap (all other ordinary JSON requests 1 MiB), allowing the specified 1 MiB decoded chunk plus envelope.

Execution owns shared durable jobs (execution_jobs), distinct from runs and physical effects. `_execution.job.create` stores the original owner/operation/input and idempotent source identity; public job.get inspects any authorized job. Controller lists pending jobs, claims generation-bound ownership, invokes the named LocalIO owner outside transactions through its exact plan, and records result/obligation. Network jobs first prepare effects and wait on their recorded outcomes. `_execution.job.record` stores result data matching the originating operation's explicit completion_schema and links actual artifact/operation evidence. Never mark a job succeeded merely because its physical request was accepted.

Tasks calls `_execution.enqueue` with ready pinned task inside the same transaction; execution creates one run for task/version and returns it. `_tasks.ready` also exposes a bounded recovery scan. Execution's verifier constructor is `NewVerifier(contract.VerifierDependencies) (contract.Verifier,error)`. Verify executes outside Unit and returns actual independently established observations under the pinned accepted profile; `_execution.verification.record` rechecks attempt/task/version before changing task state. A forged worker-provided VerificationResult is never accepted through public report. Concrete context/adapter/verification payload schemas are included in relevant prompts.

Administrative effects that have no task use their command/operation ID as an accountable admission root; no fictional worker/task or fabricated task foreign key is required. Accounting skips absent scope dimensions but always reserves installation and present organization ancestors/project limits. Task effects additionally share root_task_id. A profile without enforceable charge bounds cannot claim a hard cap.

Typed handler bindings return `contract.Outcome[O]` so accepted results and page cursors survive typed registration. The frozen Bind signature is `Bind[I, O any](contract.Descriptor, func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. Errors carry Fault and roll back, while accepted/completed status and cursor come from Outcome.

Assembly order: application.NewPorts() returns an unbound *PortRouter; For(owner string) returns an owner-bound contract.Ports without domain calls; construct identity and all other modules with those ports; registry.New(modules); application.New(db, registry, identityAuthenticator, clock, ids); router.Bind(app) exactly once; start serving only after Bind. PortRouter exposes `For(string) contract.Ports` and `Bind(*Application) error`, rejects pre-bind invocation, and never allows a domain to change its bound caller identity. Registry also implements Module for its own capabilities methods. Constructor execution must not query peers or start goroutines.

All native BlobStore objects are encrypted at rest (including public-classification content), because Stage has no classification argument. Metadata publication sets encrypted=true; classification separately governs disclosure. Controller records the raw adapter observation and cost disposition durably first, then publishes StagedOutput bytes outside Unit, then commits artifact metadata and normalized owner callbacks through an outbox consumer. Publication failure is a visible artifact obligation and blocks task/job acceptance; it does not erase a confirmed provider observation or authorize resending. The adapter cannot mint artifact IDs.

Entrypoint assembly owns platform.Acquire -> storage.Open -> Migrate -> Database.StartGeneration, exactly once before controller/server admission. Pass the held contract.Ownership into controller.New; controller never acquires a second lock or advances generation again. Ownership.Lost closes when ownership is lost/released; stop admission immediately. Generation is a persisted local-controller fence, not distributed locking. The installation lock is retained until controller shutdown and DB close.

Remote TLS additionally validates the certificate chain and maps the SHA-256 certificate SPKI fingerprint through application.AuthenticateCertificate(ctx,Digest), which delegates to identity Authenticator.AuthenticateCertificate on a read snapshot. Only a verified TLS peer can enter that API; operation input cannot supply the fingerprint. Store certificate fingerprints as identity-owned authentication metadata on an explicitly provisioned credential reference. If a bearer credential is also supplied, its principal must match the verified certificate principal. No self-asserted certificate name, profile name or fingerprint header grants authority.

Every async operation declares completion_schema separately from its immediate Job response. job.get returns that schema as Job.result only when established; pending jobs omit result. Local IO mutations that may be recovered asynchronously accept either their completed resource output or `{job: Job}` in the descriptor output schema. Bootstrap remains synchronous under its exclusive one-time lock. No unspecified job kind may execute: _execution.job.create requires a registered completion_schema or a specifically registered private local-intent recovery contract.

Evidence retains the complete original result envelope for command replay, including fault message/details/retryability and cursor; projections of status/data/error_code must agree with Command.result. `_evidence.command.finish` takes that exact result. A replay cannot reconstruct a different error or lose an accepted job reference. ScopeRequired lists installation_id where input scope is required; resource-specific organization/project/worker conditions are enforced by the owned operation schemas and current referenced-resource validation, never inferred from a profile name.

Descriptor.Callers carries the exact catalog internal caller allowlist into runtime registration; application enforces this metadata rather than inventing it from operation names. Internal metadata remains available to trusted assembly/registry while public capability output contains public operations only. An empty allowlist never authorizes an internal call.

## Owned product requirements

### R2.2-002 (source section 2.2; primary owner identity)

An external agent may use MCP or invoke the CLI in JSON mode to discover operations and operate every authorized product capability. Zatiti does not require its own chat UI, a proprietary planning model, or a separate human-only administration API.

### R2.2-003 (source section 2.2; primary owner identity)

Agent access and worker execution are distinct:

### R2.2-004 (source section 2.2; primary owner identity)

- A **client agent** manages Zatiti using a scoped principal. Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or another compatible client can fill this role.
- A **worker** is a persistent Zatiti identity and configuration. An executor may run a hosted model loop or an external agent may claim work for it.
- An **executor** owns a particular process or cooperative run attempt. Supporting a client over MCP does not imply that Zatiti can launch or sandbox that client's application.

### R2.2-005 (source section 2.2; primary owner identity)

Full operation means complete API coverage under the principal's authority. It does not mean permission to expand that authority, bypass provider consent, read stored secret bytes, or satisfy a human-required decision by claiming that a human approved it.

### R2.4-002 (source section 2.4; primary owner controller)

V1 does not include a standalone web client, a mobile client, hosted multitenancy, remote MCP over HTTP, high availability, multiple active controllers, automatic controller migration, cloud fleet provisioning, a marketplace, or a universal guarantee of exactly-once effects. Social publishing, external chat ingestion, arbitrary third-party server execution, and additional provider adapters can follow the same contracts later; they do not gate the first release. The desktop framework remains an implementation decision; a browser-based renderer inside the desktop application does not imply a separately supported web product.

### R2.4-003 (source section 2.4; primary owner controller)

An external worker is advisory in v1. A contained runner is a separately qualified extension, not an implied property of MCP, a subprocess, or a container. Zatiti does not require a particular coding planner or fleet scheduler.

### R4-002 (source section 4; primary owner contract)

| Entity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Installation | One administrative trust and storage boundary |
| Principal | Authenticated human, client agent, worker, or service identity |
| Organization | Versioned responsibility scope with one chief, optional parent, shared memory, and inherited authority and budget ceilings |
| Responsibility | Ongoing outcome mandate with an owner, triggers, reasoning policy, limits, and review criteria; creates bounded tasks |
| Memory binding | Explicit read, write, or promotion access to a worker, organization, or installation Serenity brain |
| Autonomy qualification | Evidence-backed permission eligibility for an exact capability, scope, and execution configuration |
| Team | Organizational grouping; membership alone grants no authority |
| Project | Explicit repository, data, connection, artifact, and budget scope |
| Worker | Persistent identity, purpose, instructions, skills, tool bindings, execution profile, limits, and delegation rules |
| Skill version | Immutable instructional package with schemas, requirements, provenance, and evaluation references |
| Tool contract | Typed operation, effect classification, input/output schemas, provider behavior, and recovery rules |
| Connection | Named provider/account identity, credential reference, allowed destinations/scopes, and validation state |
| Binding | Explicit attachment of a tool, skill, connection, worker, or repository to a permitted scope |
| Configuration plan | Exact proposed definition changes, expected revision, dependencies, authority delta, and required decisions |
| Task | Desired outcome, owner, assignee, inputs, dependencies, acceptance contract, and limits |
| Run / run attempt | One task execution / one executor lifetime within it |
| Operation / operation attempt | One logical protected effect / one physical provider invocation |
| Review / decision | A request for an exact action / an immutable eligible principal response |
| Artifact / event | Immutable output bytes / an observed state transition or fact |

### R4-003 (source section 4; primary owner contract)

Use stable UUID identities, explicit enums, UTC timestamps, and monotonically increasing resource versions. Human-readable keys resolve within explicit organization/project scope. Every public mutation validates the referenced objects and current scope. Missing scope is an error when ambiguous; an implicit global organization is not selected on an agent's behalf.

### R4-004 (source section 4; primary owner contract)

Proposed Go ownership boundaries are `identity`, `configuration`, `skills`, `connections`, `policy`, `tasks`, `execution`, `accounting`, `artifacts`, and `evidence`, with transport and platform packages around them. Application services compose transactions through owner methods. A module does not mutate another owner's tables through raw SQL. Add packages when behavior warrants them, not merely to mirror this table.

### R7.2-002 (source section 7.2; primary owner connections)

A tool contract defines stable identity/version, schemas, read/disclosure/mutation classification, destinations, credential requirements, cost bounds, timeout, idempotency semantics, provider confirmations, and reconciliation behavior. Registered Go adapters execute trusted effects. A worker receives only the tools in its pinned binding closure.

### R7.2-003 (source section 7.2; primary owner connections)

Zatiti's MCP server exposes the management API to clients. Connecting to an external MCP server as a worker tool source is a separate integration capability. Discovery is not execution authorization: schema changes, redirects, authentication, callbacks and subprocess behavior need a reviewed adapter contract. V1 does not execute arbitrary external MCP servers or imported plugins merely because a client can describe one.

### R9-002 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Tasks pin an accountable principal, organization/project, assigned worker, outcome, input artifacts, required outputs, acceptance contract and resource envelope. Acceptance identifies verifier code/version, sealed inputs, expected observations and whether independent verification or authorized manual acceptance is required. Workers may propose contracts, but cannot replace their task's accepted verifier during execution.

### R9-003 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Task states are `draft`, `ready`, `running`, `waiting`, `verifying`, `succeeded`, `failed`, and `cancelled`. Waiting includes explicit dependencies, human decisions, prerequisites and recovery owners. Cancellation records intent first; terminal cancellation requires owned execution to stop or be conclusively fenced, and unresolved effects remain visible separately. A worker report and process exit do not independently set `succeeded`.

### R9-004 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Runs pin effective configuration and input versions. Each run attempt has one executor, lease, generation, heartbeat, resource reservation and output disposition. Retrying creates a new attempt; it cannot silently change the accepted task contract. A failed verification cannot release dependents whose acceptance requires verified success. A manual acceptance decision remains labeled manual rather than represented as automated proof.

### R9-005 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Zatiti owns the model loop used by chiefs and ongoing responsibilities. Specialist tasks may use external harness adapters under the same task and effect contracts. Adapters declare supported capabilities, including checkpointing, continuation, interruption, context capture, and cost reporting; unsupported guarantees fail explicitly rather than being inferred from a harness name. An external harness does not own a second copy of Zatiti's task graph.

### R9-006 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

The initial executors are:

### R9-007 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

- **Hosted loop:** a configured provider adapter runs bounded model steps with only the declared tools and credential broker. Model calls, disclosure and costs follow the same scope and accounting rules.
- **Cooperative external worker:** an authorized client claims work, receives pinned task context and lease identity, sends heartbeats/checkpoints, proposes governed effects, and submits artifacts and completion observations. Zatiti verifies the submitted result independently. The worker's external shell, network and billing remain advisory unless a separately qualified execution boundary contains them.

### R9-008 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Claim/heartbeat/report APIs bind the worker, attempt and generation. Concurrent claims cannot create two current owners. Lease expiry fences future Zatiti mutations but does not prove the old process stopped; a replacement waits for explicit recovery disposition of conflicting resources and possible external effects. A caller cannot report for another attempt or turn a stale result into current completion.

### R9-009 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Schedules reference pinned task templates, explicit time zones, occurrence keys, and misfire rules. Default missed occurrences coalesce once within a configured catch-up window; pause disables admission. Daylight-saving changes and repeated polling cannot duplicate an admitted occurrence. Conditions such as cancellation or a recorded reply are checked transactionally at wake. v1 reply conditions use explicit authenticated events; external chat-channel intake is a later adapter.

### R9-010 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Child tasks inherit intersected authority, project data, deadlines and root budgets. Parent completion criteria explicitly state which child outcomes are required. Delegation depth, child count, concurrency, planner steps and wall time are finite. No nested fleet scheduler may claim ownership of the same Zatiti task graph.

### R9-011 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Responsibilities support both durable schedules/event subscriptions and repeated reasoning. A responsibility records what outcome to pursue, what signals to inspect, when to reconsider, its finite per-cycle and aggregate spending limits, and conditions for pausing or escalating. Reasoning cycles may discover and propose useful work even without a new external event. Every cycle is a bounded admitted run with a durable next-wake decision, a minimum reconsideration interval, and accountable outputs; an idle loop cannot spend indefinitely or silently create unbounded tasks. The operator can pause a responsibility without cancelling unrelated work.

### R9-012 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Agent messages use durable mailboxes with sender, recipient, organization scope, task references, and stable message identity. Receipt is acknowledged only after durable target admission; redelivery deduplicates by identity. Running workers receive admitted messages at a safe step boundary, and idle workers can be resumed. Coordination messages and unsolicited context remain untrusted observations, never replacement authority. Direct user instructions and chief assignments converge on versioned tasks so concurrent conversations cannot silently overwrite responsibility.

### R9-013 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

For the owned loop, every model-visible input must be reconstructable from persisted context: user messages, tool definitions and results, memory excerpts, effective instructions, and injected agent messages. Persist the request context before model dispatch and the protected effect intent before tool dispatch. Compaction retains lineage to its source context. External executors declare the limits of their context capture; Zatiti must not advertise exact transcript replay when an adapter cannot supply it.

### R15-002 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

Serenity supplies accumulated knowledge; Zatiti owns execution state, authorization, acceptance, budgets, and recovery obligations. Use its public interfaces through a pinned adapter, without importing its internal packages or creating a competing canonical memory writer. The integration must qualify the pinned implementation rather than treating upstream documentation as proof of supported behavior.

### R15-003 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

Each worker has an individual brain, each organization has a shared brain, and the installation has a separate brain for deliberately shared cross-organizational knowledge. The personal chief's worker memory, the root organization's shared memory, and installation-wide memory remain distinct scopes even when one chief curates them. Separate brains are logical access boundaries enforced by Zatiti's bindings; they do not isolate data from the installation administrator or unrestricted same-user filesystem access.

### R15-004 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

Memory bindings explicitly name read, write, curate/promote, and retract permissions. Zatiti resolves the caller's current worker, task, project, organization ancestry, and grants before selecting brains to query. Filter before retrieval or model composition, not after unauthorized data has already reached a model. An organization brain contains only knowledge suitable for its authorized readers; restricted project information remains in a narrower bound brain or governed artifact. Parentage alone never grants read access to a child's private knowledge.

### R15-005 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

Organization chiefs automatically curate shared memory within their standing authority: reconcile evidence, retain useful lessons, identify contradictions, and promote suitable knowledge from permitted worker or child-organization sources. The personal chief curates installation-wide memory. Automatic curation is scoped work with budgets and evidence, not permission to read everything. Promotion is a new destination claim linked to source brain, claim/version, supporting artifact references, curator identity, and any redaction. It requires both source disclosure authority and destination write authority. Shared-memory writes that exceed that envelope wait for the appropriate decision.

### R15-006 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

Corrections and retractions propagate through recorded promotion lineage as durable reconciliation obligations. A promoted statement is not independent corroboration of its own source. Revocation blocks subsequent retrieval immediately; it cannot erase already disclosed context. Forget/retract operations distinguish removal from active recall from historical erasure, including copies in Git history, backups, and prior run artifacts. The UI must state that distinction when relevant.

### R15-007 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

The adapter provides memory recall, remember, inspect, promotion, and retraction operations through the shared registry and exposes their supported prerequisites and outcomes equally through CLI and MCP. Desktop memory controls and conversational requests call those same operations. Recalled results retain scope, source references, confidence, relevant versions, and freshness; each run stores the actual selected context as an artifact. Reads across brains are not presumed to be one atomic snapshot. A task requiring unavailable freshness waits or reports a prerequisite failure rather than silently treating stale context as current.

### R15-008 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

Serenity's exported Go read facade may serve compatible reads. Canonical writes go to exactly one writer owner per brain through the supported protocol. Its Recall path may invoke models and record spend: "read" does not imply no disclosure or no charge. Composition, embedding, extraction, and curation must obey Zatiti's provider disclosure rules and reservations; until the adapter can enforce a required bound, that execution mode is unavailable or explicitly advisory where policy permits. Serenity's remembered judgments and plan checks inform work but cannot override Zatiti policy or constitute task acceptance on their own.

### R15-009 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

Zatiti's SQLite transaction cannot atomically commit a Serenity write. Persist a submission intent and adapter command identity before dispatch, record the actual disposition afterward, and reconcile a lost acknowledgment without blindly repeating the write. Backup manifests pin the required brain revisions and key-recovery prerequisites alongside Zatiti state. Restore starts paused and reconciles pending memory writes and promotions before resuming curation. Availability failures remain visible; no failed memory operation is presented as remembered knowledge.

### Local schema definitions

The schemas above resolve exclusively against this embedded `$defs` object. Input objects reject additional properties except explicitly open schema/data fields. Field semantics are completed by the owned requirements and operation descriptions. Output `resource`, `items`, `draft`, `job`, etc. are literal keys. Pagination cursor lives in the common envelope.

## Local adapter, context, verifier and backup payloads

These local schemas freeze the handoff between execution, adapters and artifact publication. They do not assert upstream compatibility.

These are exact Zatiti-side contracts, not representations of upstream APIs. Adapter implementation translates to a pinned, separately qualified public upstream protocol; unsupported semantics fail capability_unsupported or preserve outcome_unknown.
To validate a named schema, place definitions under the root $defs and reference the selected name. The catalog container uses definitions for packaging only; every embedded #/$defs/Name resolves against that assembled validation document. JSON Schema dialect is 2020-12.
Validate strict objects, formats, explicit field limits, duplicate-key rejection and exact integer bounds. Runtime must also enforce total JSON/artifact byte limits, at most 64 JSON levels and 100000 schema/input nodes; schema documents and dynamic tool arguments cannot escape the qualified local validation dialect.
Opaque references, URLs, headers and diagnostics must never contain secret bytes. Profile configuration is trusted local configuration; public operation arguments cannot install profiles, select a more privileged credential, open an arbitrary server path or replace capability evidence.
Before dispatch, profile capability evidence must match the canonical profile digest computed with the capability_evidence field omitted; self-referential capability evidence and qualification records do not grant authority. The binding/effect owner independently checks current account, scope, destinations, classification, prices and qualified capability.
PhysicalCallEvidence records exactly one physical network request per claimed attempt. request_context identifies the pre-dispatch persisted request. No adapter adds preflight, redirect, polling, SDK retry or model tool execution inside that request; each such external action requires a separate governed attempt.
StagedOutput is an IO handoff, not a published ArtifactRef. Adapter stages bytes and returns staging_ref/digest metadata; controller uses the artifacts owner to publish metadata and replace staged locators with real ArtifactRefs before delivering normalized observations to execution/memory/other domains. output_artifacts may be empty at adapter return and contains the resulting published refs in recorded domain evidence. ArtifactLocator staged references must match exactly one StagedOutput in the same observation. Failed publication remains a visible obligation/fault.
ContextArtifact.messages and each parts array preserve the exact model-visible semantic order. Tool definitions, memory excerpts and injected messages must all appear in the persisted request context before dispatch. Context source artifacts and compaction lineage do not replace retaining the actual selected text. Complete capture is required for owned hosted loops; external capture limitations remain explicit.
Model tool proposals are observations. tool ID/version must match the pinned context tool closure; operation ID/version must be the qualified mapping for that tool. Validate input against that exact schema and apply current authority/review/budgets before a separate operation. Never execute a model proposal directly in an adapter.
Responses input_rate.unit must equal input_token and output_rate.unit output_token; profile currencies and all reported/reserved usage must agree. Round admission reservations upward using checked integer rational arithmetic. Missing or unbounded required charges refuse hard-cap mode. A null/absent upstream usage report maps to unknown/advisory billing, never free success.
GitHubParameters is discriminated by kind. read_repository requires branch for ref, sha for commit/tree/blob, and pull_request_number for pull_request; irrelevant resource selectors are rejected. Relative repository paths and branch syntax receive Git-aware validation. Profile allowed_actions must be separately qualified against real API preconditions and downstream automation.
GitHub push_commit publishes an already prepared exact commit SHA in one qualified physical request. Creating remote blobs, trees or commits is not hidden inside Invoke: it needs an explicit separately admitted decomposition and qualification before enabling that route. Preflight evidence cannot substitute for atomic provider preconditions where the action requires protection against a race; refuse unsupported guarantees.
GitHub open_pull_request and merge_pull_request are consequential effects bound to exact account/repository/head/base/content/timing/automation constraints. A successful HTTP response or accepted request is not independently assumed confirmed completion; response interpretation follows the qualified contract. Eventual not-found never proves nonexecution.
HTTPRead v1 max_redirects is exactly zero. Return redirect_location as evidence/prerequisite and require a separately authorized read for the new URL. Validate DNS results and bind validated dial addresses; reject local/private/link-local/metadata targets unless explicitly permitted by an installation-authorized destination binding. Header values reject controls and duplicate header names; Authorization, Cookie and arbitrary raw credential input are excluded.
Serenity profile endpoints/root_ref/writer_owner are opaque locally provisioned mappings, not model-selectable arbitrary filesystem locations. They identify real pinned public protocol/read-facade support. Zatiti never imports upstream internal packages or invents public endpoints from these local operation names.
Serenity recall/remember/promote may incur disclosure or charges. All nested upstream provider destinations and spend must fit enforcement; unsupported enforceable bounds disable the mode or require explicitly permitted advisory use. Promote resolves and authorizes source content before preparing the destination write and retains the source evidence; it does not perform an unaccounted extra source read inside Invoke.
Serenity adapter_command_id is the durable pre-dispatch command identity. Its existence does not prove upstream idempotency: reconcile through qualified status semantics, retaining unknown after lost acknowledgement if authoritative lookup is unavailable. One writer owner per brain. Retract removes active recall and leaves historical_erasure false; promotion correction lineage remains a durable memory-owner obligation.
Verification profiles are installation-owned and pinned before task execution. command_id, runner_profile and environment_profile resolve only to prequalified local verifiers; no request supplies executable paths or argv. ArtifactVerifierProfile runs presence/digest/schema checks; RepositoryVerifierProfile runs the pinned controlled patch/check profile outside Unit. A worker cannot alter profile bytes, accepted inputs or result authority.
VerificationResult.independent=true is necessary structure, not trust evidence: only the trusted runner may submit that result through its internal admission identity. Match task/attempt, acceptance digest, verifier identity/version/digest and request artifact before accepting. Passed requires all sealed expected checks observed as required; unavailable, interrupted, worker assertion and process exit zero alone cannot succeed a task. Manual acceptance uses the separate task operation and never fabricates an independent result.
BackupManifest is inside an authenticated encrypted bundle; it never includes decrypting master keys. archive_entry values are normalized relative entries with no traversal, absolute paths, symlinks, duplicate/case collisions or devices. Verify database/artifact/brain digests and qualified revision exports before marking backup verified. Large manifests stream through bounded artifact IO, not public JSON request bodies.
Restore starts paused under exclusive maintenance, validates installation binding and key prerequisites, and retains current recovery overlay before rewinding. Merge revocations, durable command identities, claimed/unknown effects, reservations and memory obligations monotonically via their owners; fail closed on conflict and retain the overlay. Overlay record artifacts must be included/pinned and encrypted. No database/brain rewind is represented as undoing an external effect.

## Named acceptance cases

Tests are implementation deliverables, not claims of already executed qualification. Retain expected/observed results, exact source/config/tool versions and failure evidence.

### Z05.malicious_instructions — Z05

Setup: A skill includes instructions to read secrets, self-grant permissions and ignore reviews.

Action: Import, bind and execute the skill in a constrained task.

Expected:

- Instructions remain untrusted input and install no grants.
- Tool, data and effect access remains limited to the pinned authorized binding closure.

### Z05.changed_tool_schema — Z05

Setup: An active worker binding pins a tool identity/version/schema.

Action: Change the provider-discovered schema or executable binding while retaining the old activation plan.

Expected:

- Changed executable meaning cannot silently enter the active tool closure.
- Revalidation and authorized activation are required; unsupported contracts return capability or prerequisite faults.

### Z05.empty_bindings — Z05

Setup: A worker has no explicit tools or cross-scope bindings.

Action: Ask it to use a known installation connection and a tool visible in discovery.

Expected:

- The worker receives no implicit global tool or credential access.
- Missing or ambiguous scope produces a named refusal rather than selecting a global organization.

### Z09.concurrent_reservations — Z09

Setup: Installation, ancestor organizations, project, worker and root-task budgets are nearly exhausted.

Action: Concurrently admit child tasks, evaluation and model calls competing for the remaining funds.

Expected:

- Atomic reservations across all applicable scopes prevent overcommit and use deterministic lock/update order.
- Children and retries consume shared root/ancestor limits rather than independent copies.

### Z09.unknown_external_cost — Z09

Setup: A cooperative external worker or provider cannot establish a reliable charge bound.

Action: Admit work requiring a hard spending cap and report unknown/advisory external usage.

Expected:

- Unenforceable hard-cap mode is refused or explicitly advisory only where policy permits.
- Unknown and advisory usage is reported separately and never treated as zero.

### Z10.duplicate_schedule_claim — Z10

Setup: One scheduled occurrence is due and multiple polls and cooperative claimants race.

Action: Poll repeatedly across timezone/DST boundaries and concurrently claim the same task.

Expected:

- The occurrence key admits at most one occurrence according to the configured misfire rule.
- Only one current attempt owner, lease and generation are committed.

### Z10.restart_identity — Z10

Setup: A task has a pinned run, active attempt, checkpoint and resource reservation.

Action: Restart the controller and continue through the supported recovery path.

Expected:

- Persisted generation advances and recovery uses durable state.
- Task/run history, accepted contract, pinned configuration and checkpoint lineage remain intact; retry creates a distinct attempt.

### Z10.stale_heartbeat — Z10

Setup: An attempt lease/generation is stale after expiry or controller restart.

Action: Send heartbeat, checkpoint and completion report from that stale owner or a different worker.

Expected:

- Stale or mismatched worker/attempt/generation requests cannot mutate current execution or complete the task.
- Lease expiry alone does not assert that the old external process stopped.

### Z10.lost_claim_ack — Z10

Setup: A cooperative claim commits and its network acknowledgement is dropped.

Action: Repeat the claim with the same submission identity and inspect the command.

Expected:

- The claimant recovers the original attempt/lease disposition.
- No duplicate current owner or replacement attempt is created merely because the acknowledgement was lost.

### Z10.conflicting_replacement — Z10

Setup: An expired attempt may still control a repository resource or have an unresolved provider effect.

Action: Request a replacement attempt.

Expected:

- Replacement waits for explicit recovery disposition of conflicting resources and possible effects.
- No unsupported containment or successful stop is inferred from lease expiry.

### Z11.exit_zero_missing_output — Z11

Setup: A task requires independently verified artifacts.

Action: Have its worker exit successfully or report success while omitting required output bytes.

Expected:

- Task does not enter succeeded.
- Missing artifacts produce a visible fault and dependents requiring verified success remain blocked.

### Z11.tampered_verifier — Z11

Setup: A task pins verifier code/version, sealed inputs and expected observations.

Action: Modify verifier bytes/version or attempt to replace acceptance during the run or retry.

Expected:

- Verification rejects a mismatched or unapproved verifier/contract.
- A worker cannot weaken the accepted contract during execution; retries retain it.

### Z11.worker_assertion — Z11

Setup: A worker submits plausible narrative success and self-generated tests.

Action: Report completion without independently accepted check evidence.

Expected:

- Worker assertions are recorded as observations rather than proof.
- Independent verification or an authorized explicitly manual acceptance is still required.

### Z11.failed_child_acceptance — Z11

Setup: A parent acceptance contract requires a designated child to pass independent checks.

Action: Have that child finish execution but fail verification.

Expected:

- The parent and dependent tasks do not satisfy verified-success conditions.
- Failed child acceptance and its evidence remain visible.

### Z12.root_limits_shared — Z12

Setup: A root task is configured with finite child count, depth, concurrency, planner steps and wall-time limits.

Action: Delegate concurrently and recursively until each limit is reached.

Expected:

- All branches share root budgets and finite limits; limits cannot be reset by making another child.
- Default limits match one worker attempt, four installation attempts, 30 minutes per attempt, 100 steps, eight children, depth three and a 24-hour root deadline where applicable.

### Z13.advisory_worker — Z13

Setup: A cooperative worker has an unrestricted external shell/network and no qualified containment adapter.

Action: Inspect capabilities, claim context, usage reports and desktop execution details.

Expected:

- External shell, network and billing limitations are explicitly advisory.
- Lease fencing is described as restricting Zatiti mutations and does not claim the external process is contained or terminated.

### Z13.compatibility_not_containment — Z13

Setup: An MCP session succeeds with a named external agent client.

Action: Evaluate execution capability declarations and release claims.

Expected:

- Client interoperability grants no implicit launch, sandbox, interruption, cost-enforcement or exact-context-replay guarantees.
- Unsupported executor guarantees fail explicitly instead of being inferred from a client, harness, container or subprocess name.

### Z18.retained_context — Z18

Setup: A run recalls several authorized brains with distinct revisions.

Action: Dispatch a model step, later update the brains and inspect the original run context.

Expected:

- The run retains the actual selected memory excerpts and provenance as artifacts.
- Inspection reconstructs what the model received; reads across brains are not falsely described as one atomic snapshot.

### Z18.revoked_memory_binding — Z18

Setup: A worker previously recalled a brain and then loses its binding.

Action: Recall again and inspect prior run artifacts.

Expected:

- Subsequent brain retrieval is denied immediately under current authority.
- The system does not claim revocation erases previously disclosed context; historical artifacts remain governed by their own retention/access rules.

### Z20.scheduled_cycles — Z20

Setup: A responsibility specifies scheduled/event triggers, finite cycle/root limits, timezone and catch-up window.

Action: Trigger normal, missed and duplicated occurrences and an authenticated event.

Expected:

- Each admitted cycle is bounded and linked to the responsibility; repeated polls/events do not duplicate task admission.
- Default missed occurrences coalesce once within the configured window and pauses disable new admission.

### Z20.reasoning_cycles — Z20

Setup: An active responsibility permits repeated reasoning without new external events and has a minimum reconsideration interval.

Action: Run a reasoning cycle that proposes useful work, then inspect its next wake and outputs.

Expected:

- The cycle is an admitted bounded run with accountable outputs and a persisted next-wake decision.
- Proposed work converges on versioned tasks and stays within task-count, scope and spending limits.

### Z20.bounded_idle_spend — Z20

Setup: A responsibility repeatedly finds no useful work and has finite per-cycle/aggregate funds and a minimum interval.

Action: Advance the deterministic clock through many potential cycles.

Expected:

- The minimum interval prevents a tight reasoning loop.
- Aggregate exhaustion or pause conditions stop new spend; idle reasoning cannot create unlimited tasks or spend indefinitely.

### Z20.mailbox_redelivery — Z20

Setup: A scoped sender submits a stable message ID to a running worker and an idle worker.

Action: Lose delivery acknowledgement, redeliver and restart at target admission.

Expected:

- Acknowledgement occurs only after durable target admission and message identity deduplicates redelivery.
- Running workers receive the message at a safe step boundary; idle workers can resume.
- Message content is an untrusted observation and cannot replace authority.

### Z21.close_client — Z21

Setup: Authorized work is running on an available controller and its continuation behavior was shown during setup.

Action: Close the desktop process, allow work to continue, then reopen it.

Expected:

- Closing the client does not stop the controller or scheduler.
- Reopened state accurately shows controller progress/results and unresolved effects.

### JOURNEY.engineering_cli — JOURNEY

Setup: A controlled repository has an explicit base head, policy, cooperative worker and independent sealed verifier.

Action: Through CLI, claim work, checkpoint, submit a patch and independent check evidence, then propose exact repository publication; also run failed-check and stale-head variants.

Expected:

- Successful acceptance is independently established and publication is governed by exact repository/branch/head/change/automation constraints.
- Failed checks block completion and stale head invalidates applicable review.
- Opening a pull request is not automatically treated as harmless when downstream automation broadens consequences.

### JOURNEY.engineering_mcp — JOURNEY

Setup: Use matching repository, worker, policy and sealed verification fixtures.

Action: Perform claim, checkpoint, patch/evidence submission and exact publication proposal entirely through MCP, including failed checks and stale head.

Expected:

- The same verified acceptance and protected-effect lifecycle is observed as through CLI.
- No arbitrary shell invocation exposed as an MCP substitute counts toward operation parity.

## Delivery

Implement production behavior and meaningful local tests within scope. Report files changed, commands actually run, observed results, unresolved dependency qualifications and contract defects. A missing dependency may use an exact local fake for development; production must return a named prerequisite/unsupported error instead of fake success. Integration owns shared dependency changes, real assembly, cross-package proving and landing. Do not advertise release or client/platform support from compilation alone.
