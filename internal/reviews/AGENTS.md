# Implementation assignment: `internal/reviews`

Generated specification revision 1; source digest `c79b39e5ca496cd59114fdaa2c9dd3a36d7c9c0d3b4426bc131063f5cef22ca2`. This file is committed implementation context. Do not independently edit it. Everything required from the product specification and adjacent interfaces is embedded below; no RFC copy is required.

## Mission and scope

Own exact reviews, eligibility checks, immutable decisions and delegated review authority.

Write scope: **`internal/reviews/` only**, excluding this generated AGENTS.md. Go package name: `reviews`. Ownership kind: domain; integration wave: 2.

Allowed production imports from this repository: `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/contract`. Tests may use interfaces/fakes defined locally and, once available, storage-backed temporary fixtures; integration owns cross-package tests. No sibling raw SQL. No root dependency edits except the integration exception stated in its own brief.

## Implementation decisions and acceptance focus

Own reviews_requests/decisions/delegations. Review preview is the actual immutable Action, not a model summary. Digest binds account/destination/content/media hashes/timing/preconditions/config/tool versions, including repository head and automation consequences. Recheck principal kind/current grant, expiry/version/action digest, optional proposer separation on decide and on effect claim. Agent cannot satisfy human-required review through CLI, claimed boolean or acting as a different profile. Human credentials in a human-authorized process do not prove physical human presence. Delegation cannot broaden eligible class, scope or authority. Changed action creates a new review or invalidates old one; keep history. Manual task acceptance is a separate eligible task operation and remains distinctly labeled.

Local proving focus: Changed content/destination/time/head, revoked/delegated reviewer, proposer separation, stale review, agent posing human, exact preview/transport denial equivalence.

## Incoming and outgoing boundaries

Incoming callers: configuration, effects, policy, tasks, application (authenticated public operations).

Outgoing owner calls: `_identity.authority`, `_configuration.snapshot`, `_policy.check`, `_tasks.snapshot`. Each exact input/output schema appears below. Calls retain current Unit/authority; owner allowlists are mandatory.

Expose `New(contract.Dependencies) (*Service,error)`; `*Service` implements `contract.Module` with Name `reviews`, owner-prefixed migrations, all owned descriptors, and strict dispatch. No calls/goroutines during construction. Implement optional authentication/LocalIO interfaces where specified in the common contract. Tables are private under `reviews_`; external callers rely only on methods and schemas.

### Imported package APIs and behavior

These briefs are embedded so you need not read a sibling prompt to discover its incoming API. Implement only your own package.

## Shared foundation contract

# Frozen implementation contract, revision 1

These decisions complete the product specification and bind every scope. Report contradictions with an affected-dependency list and proposed coordinated revision; do not change another owner's interface locally.

## Build and dependency decisions

Module `github.com/zatiti/zatiti`; language `go 1.26.0`; initial toolchain `go1.26.2`. Integration owns go.mod/go.sum. Domains import standard library and internal/contract, not sibling domains. Application composes owner methods through a checked in-process dispatcher: ordinary Go calls, not another server or scheduler.

Library families: Cobra CLI; official MCP Go SDK, handwritten adapter for MCP `2025-11-25`; Fyne v2 native Go desktop; modernc.org/sqlite. Mint is optional build-time tooling and cannot weaken contracts. Hosted provider v1: a specifically qualified OpenAI Responses endpoint/profile, with configured model and prices. Other compatible endpoints remain unavailable until qualified. GitHub uses documented REST over net/http, with mutation retries disabled. Serenity is a separate pinned service using public interfaces only. Integration must resolve exact dependency releases/commits, checksums, licenses and qualification commands in a lock report BEFORE dispatching dependent implementation. These are selected implementation families, not claims that upstream behavior has been qualified. No agent independently substitutes libraries, models, prices, accounts or Serenity APIs. Dependency resolution/qualification is an explicit foundation assignment.

## Shared Go declarations

The contract owner implements these exact declarations. Omitted function bodies are the implementation assignment, not production stubs. Public JSON uses snake_case. Schema-derived DTO names concatenate operation path segments in PascalCase plus Input/Output and live in the owning package. JSON integer => int64, UUID => contract.ID, timestamp => time.Time, optional scalar => pointer, array => slice, explicitly open JSON => json.RawMessage. Unknown fields are rejected.

The registry binds concrete input/output DTO types to descriptors and handlers using `Bind[I, O any](descriptor contract.Descriptor, fn func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. JSON decoding is strict and schema validation precedes execution. Internal cross-owner calls use the same schema-checked Invocation boundary to avoid sibling package imports. They retain the same Unit, actor, scope, generation and transaction; cannot mint authority; and are not exposed as public operations.

## Transaction and ownership rules

Each domain owns tables prefixed with its package name and `_`. Schema and migration bodies inside that namespace are package-private; no other package depends on their layout. Storage owns installation generation, migration metadata and `storage_events`. Evidence owns commands/receipts. Migration ordering is explicit in application assembly. All migrations run under exclusive installation ownership before serving. Cross-owner reads and changes use Ports.Call and the embedded internal schemas. Internal operations have a caller allowlist. The dispatcher detects recursive calls. Queries cannot invoke mutation descriptors. Public clients cannot supply Actor or Unit or invoke internal operations.

One controller, one ordered writer, WAL, foreign keys on every connection, synchronous FULL, busy timeout 5 seconds, consistent read snapshots. Database.Write performs ONE transaction callback attempt with no automatic callback retry. Busy exhaustion returns controller_unavailable/retryable. Unit is valid only inside its callback; no goroutines or retained handles. Unit.Emit appends state-correlated evidence to the storage outbox in the same transaction. Delivery is at least once and consumers deduplicate event IDs. No network/model calls, secret-store access, filesystem streaming or subprocess work inside a Unit. Stage bytes or local helper actions outside transactions, then publish metadata or reconciliation intent through owner methods.

Handler errors roll back the entire transaction. Persist a command refusal in a separate short transaction after rollback where necessary, retaining the original request identity. Query command IDs need not be durable. All mutations return durable command IDs; accepted responses must identify inspectable durable work. Output schemas describe Payload.Data, not the result envelope. Never leak SQL, tokens, provider raw responses or private paths through Fault.

Definition creates/updates/archive stage drafts, including schedules, responsibilities, policies and memory bindings. Only configuration.apply activates definitions. It validates owners' candidate slices, seals base revision/dependencies/requirements, and calls internal activate in the same transaction under old authority. Internal activate is admitted only from the compiler during exact plan application, not by a public flag. Public restrictive pause/revoke/cancel commits immediately without compilation or spending. Archive staging may immediately disable new admissions as an explicitly reported restrictive side effect; final removal waits for obligations.

## Effect and execution rules

Admit: current authorization, exact review/preconditions, all budget reservations, attempt/dispatch intent and evidence atomically. Claim: second transaction rechecks generation/restrictions/expiry and consumes the one-use claim. Invoke the adapter outside transactions. Record: third transaction stores observations, costs or retained uncertainty and events. Each physical call, including reconciliation and retries, has a distinct attempt. Reconciliation is an admitted bounded read and links to the original effect; it does not overwrite history. Internal jobs use explicitly provisioned scoped service identities plus current worker/task restrictions.

Once claimed, crash/timeout/cancel/lease expiry/operator acknowledgement/weak not-found cannot prove nonexecution. Preserve outcome_unknown and its reservation until authoritative evidence. Earlier unknown attempts survive later failures. Mutation SDK/HTTP retries are disabled. Even qualified idempotent retries need fresh authorization and physical-attempt evidence. Trusted adapters resolve credential references outside transactions; no public raw secrets or inherited owner credential environment. Fencing external workers blocks Zatiti mutations but cannot prove their processes stopped.

Task success needs independently established acceptance against pinned verifier code/version, sealed inputs and observations. Worker report/exit zero cannot set succeeded. Defaults: one concurrent attempt/worker, four/installation, 30 minutes/attempt, 100 model steps, eight children, delegation depth three, root deadline 24 hours. Configure explicit currency and finite spend limits before paid work. Amounts are int64 micro-units with checked overflow; rational rates use integer numerator/denominator and round reservations upward. Unknown/advisory usage and missing prices are not zero. Children share root and ancestor budgets.

## Wire conventions and limits

UUIDv4 for new identities; stable UUID references thereafter. SHA-256 lowercase hex digests. Versioned canonical JSON sorts keys, rejects duplicate keys/unknown fields, preserves exact integer values and semantic array order; schema-declared sets sort by stable identity. Preserve exact skill bytes. UTC RFC3339Nano timestamps and int64 versions >=1. Patches and snapshots are distinct; explicit delete only. Inert `extensions` alone permits namespaced extra keys. Scope is explicit and every referenced object is revalidated; no implicit global organization.

Default limits: JSON request 1 MiB; chunk 1 MiB decoded; artifact 256 MiB; skill archive 16 MiB compressed, 64 MiB expanded, 4096 entries, depth 32; list 50/max 200; read 1 MiB; redacted log record 8 KiB; event page 100/max 500; upload expiry 24 hours. Narrowing is allowed, increases require authorized configuration. Reject overflow and unsupported bounds.

Mutations require submission_key (1..128 printable ASCII) except one-time init. Bind principal, operation/version and canonical input hash. Retain >=30 days and through unresolved obligations. Replay identical input returns original disposition BEFORE stale-version validation; changed input => submission_conflict. Concurrent duplicates serialize. Recover lost acknowledgements by command lookup, not a new key. Resource updates require expected_version; apply requires base_revision and plan digest. Creation has no existing version. Opaque authenticated cursors bind principal/scope/filter/order/snapshot and expire explicitly with cursor_expired and snapshot_required=true. Event replay cannot silently omit a gap.

HTTP POST `/v1/operations/{operation_id}` uses the common request envelope. Local HTTP runs over a private Unix socket. Explicit remote desktop uses mutual TLS mapped to current application principals over the same operation contract, never remote MCP. Completed => HTTP 200; accepted => 202. Failed mapping: invalid_input 400, permission_denied 403, not_found 404, stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict/review_required/outcome_unknown/artifact_fault 409, cursor_expired 410, prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported/verification_failed 422, controller_unavailable 503, internal_error 500. Domain failures always include the result envelope.

CLI completed/accepted => exit 0; invalid_input 2; permission_denied/review_required 3; stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict 4; prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported 5; controller_unavailable/outcome_unknown 6; other failures 1. CLI --json emits one envelope to stdout, diagnostics stderr, no implicit prompts. MCP structuredContent is the full envelope, text is equivalent JSON, failed => isError true, malformed protocol => protocol error. Dot-separated operation IDs map to CLI tokens and `zatiti_` MCP names. Exceptions: installation.init => `zatiti init` / `zatiti_installation_init`; capabilities.list => `zatiti capabilities` / `zatiti_capabilities`. Lifecycle steps are individual tools. Tool input never selects a credential profile or accepts raw secrets/unrestricted server paths.

## Completion policy

Write only within the assigned root. Do not edit this prompt, siblings, shared contracts, root dependencies or external acceptance inputs. Implement exact fake dependencies locally; do not return invented production success for unavailable prerequisites. Use controlled providers, deterministic clocks and synthetic fixtures. Preserve expected/observed results and failure evidence. Package tests prove local properties; actual subprocess parity, crash recovery, desktop and adapter qualification prove integration. Z01-Z21 and first-release journeys on macOS/Linux must pass before a release is claimed.

## Local IO, authentication, jobs and verification seams

These additional declarations are part of the SAME frozen contract package (using imports already shown). Implementing an interface does not permit calling it inside a Unit except where the signature explicitly takes Unit/Reader.

```go
type Authenticator interface {
    Authenticate(context.Context, Reader, []byte) (Actor, error)
    AuthenticateCertificate(context.Context, Reader, Digest) (Actor, error)
}
type IOPlan struct {
    ID ID
    Owner string
    Invocation Invocation
    Actor Actor
    Scope Scope
    Generation int64
    ExpectedVersions map[ID]Version
    Prepared json.RawMessage
}
type IOResult struct { Data json.RawMessage; Fault *Fault }
type LocalIO interface {
    Prepare(context.Context, Unit, Invocation) (IOPlan, error)
    Perform(context.Context, IOPlan) (IOResult, error)
    Finish(context.Context, Unit, IOPlan, IOResult) (Payload, error)
}
// Request is the exact VerificationRequest JSON schema embedded in the prompt.
type Verification struct { Request json.RawMessage }
// Document is the exact VerificationResult schema, including independently
// observed checks, pinned identity, task/attempt and staged artifact handoff.
type VerificationResult struct { Document json.RawMessage }
type Verifier interface {
    Verify(context.Context, Verification) (VerificationResult, error)
}
type VerifierDependencies struct { Clock Clock; Blobs BlobStore }
```

Identity Service also implements Authenticator. Application receives this interface explicitly in New; it uses a dedicated read snapshot and never reads identity-owned tables itself. Only the byte-slice credential boundary carries secret authentication material, never Invocation JSON. Zero sensitive buffers after use where practical; no logging. Certificate authentication resolves a preprovisioned credential reference and follows the same current principal/revocation rules.

Artifacts, skills, connections and installation Services also implement LocalIO. The registry detects this interface at assembly and routes ONLY registered local IO operations through Prepare/Perform/Finish: artifact.upload.chunk/finish/cancel/read/export; skill.import; connection.setup.begin/complete/cancel; installation.init/backup/restore. LocalIO handles local bounded files, secure helpers and backup work, never unadmitted provider/model calls. Prepare strictly validates input, versions, identity and authority and records replayable local intent under IOPlan.ID; Perform receives that exact trusted in-memory plan outside transactions, resolves opaque staging/helper references, and returns metadata; Finish rechecks authority/versions/generation and commits result/evidence. IOPlan is never public, accepted from an agent or stored with secrets. Prepared/Data JSON must use the operation's declared schemas plus private owner-local metadata, which no other package reads. No cross-owner business protocol may hide in those private fields. Perform must support safe replay of local staging/publication by plan ID, or preserve an inspectable failed/unknown local obligation. A synchronous read does not return bytes to client until final authorization check. New raw provider writes always use effects, not this interface.

For synchronous local IO mutations, persist command identity plus accepted internal pending disposition at Prepare, then replace pending disposition once at Finish. Concurrent same-key calls join/inspect that same in-progress command and never run duplicate Perform. The controller can recover abandoned local intents using the execution job API. Async backup/export uses the same interface with an inspectable job returned immediately. The artifact.upload.chunk endpoint has a 2 MiB encoded request cap (all other ordinary JSON requests 1 MiB), allowing the specified 1 MiB decoded chunk plus envelope.

Execution owns shared durable jobs (execution_jobs), distinct from runs and physical effects. `_execution.job.create` stores the original owner/operation/input and idempotent source identity; public job.get inspects any authorized job. Controller lists pending jobs, claims generation-bound ownership, invokes the named LocalIO owner outside transactions through its exact plan, and records result/obligation. Network jobs first prepare effects and wait on their recorded outcomes. `_execution.job.record` stores result data matching the originating operation's explicit completion_schema and links actual artifact/operation evidence. Never mark a job succeeded merely because its physical request was accepted.

Tasks calls `_execution.enqueue` with ready pinned task inside the same transaction; execution creates one run for task/version and returns it. `_tasks.ready` also exposes a bounded recovery scan. Execution's verifier constructor is `NewVerifier(contract.VerifierDependencies) (contract.Verifier,error)`. Verify executes outside Unit and returns actual independently established observations under the pinned accepted profile; `_execution.verification.record` rechecks attempt/task/version before changing task state. A forged worker-provided VerificationResult is never accepted through public report. Concrete context/adapter/verification payload schemas are included in relevant prompts.

Administrative effects that have no task use their command/operation ID as an accountable admission root; no fictional worker/task or fabricated task foreign key is required. Accounting skips absent scope dimensions but always reserves installation and present organization ancestors/project limits. Task effects additionally share root_task_id. A profile without enforceable charge bounds cannot claim a hard cap.

Typed handler bindings return `contract.Outcome[O]` so accepted results and page cursors survive typed registration. The frozen Bind signature is `Bind[I, O any](contract.Descriptor, func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. Errors carry Fault and roll back, while accepted/completed status and cursor come from Outcome.

Assembly order: application.NewPorts() returns an unbound *PortRouter; For(owner string) returns an owner-bound contract.Ports without domain calls; construct identity and all other modules with those ports; registry.New(modules); application.New(db, registry, identityAuthenticator, clock, ids); router.Bind(app) exactly once; start serving only after Bind. PortRouter exposes `For(string) contract.Ports` and `Bind(*Application) error`, rejects pre-bind invocation, and never allows a domain to change its bound caller identity. Registry also implements Module for its own capabilities methods. Constructor execution must not query peers or start goroutines.

All native BlobStore objects are encrypted at rest (including public-classification content), because Stage has no classification argument. Metadata publication sets encrypted=true; classification separately governs disclosure. Controller records the raw adapter observation and cost disposition durably first, then publishes StagedOutput bytes outside Unit, then commits artifact metadata and normalized owner callbacks through an outbox consumer. Publication failure is a visible artifact obligation and blocks task/job acceptance; it does not erase a confirmed provider observation or authorize resending. The adapter cannot mint artifact IDs.

Entrypoint assembly owns platform.Acquire -> storage.Open -> Migrate -> Database.StartGeneration, exactly once before controller/server admission. Pass the held contract.Ownership into controller.New; controller never acquires a second lock or advances generation again. Ownership.Lost closes when ownership is lost/released; stop admission immediately. Generation is a persisted local-controller fence, not distributed locking. The installation lock is retained until controller shutdown and DB close.

Remote TLS additionally validates the certificate chain and maps the SHA-256 certificate SPKI fingerprint through application.AuthenticateCertificate(ctx,Digest), which delegates to identity Authenticator.AuthenticateCertificate on a read snapshot. Only a verified TLS peer can enter that API; operation input cannot supply the fingerprint. Store certificate fingerprints as identity-owned authentication metadata on an explicitly provisioned credential reference. If a bearer credential is also supplied, its principal must match the verified certificate principal. No self-asserted certificate name, profile name or fingerprint header grants authority.

Every async operation declares completion_schema separately from its immediate Job response. job.get returns that schema as Job.result only when established; pending jobs omit result. Local IO mutations that may be recovered asynchronously accept either their completed resource output or `{job: Job}` in the descriptor output schema. Bootstrap remains synchronous under its exclusive one-time lock. No unspecified job kind may execute: _execution.job.create requires a registered completion_schema or a specifically registered private local-intent recovery contract.

Evidence retains the complete original result envelope for command replay, including fault message/details/retryability and cursor; projections of status/data/error_code must agree with Command.result. `_evidence.command.finish` takes that exact result. A replay cannot reconstruct a different error or lose an accepted job reference. ScopeRequired lists installation_id where input scope is required; resource-specific organization/project/worker conditions are enforced by the owned operation schemas and current referenced-resource validation, never inferred from a profile name.

Descriptor.Callers carries the exact catalog internal caller allowlist into runtime registration; application enforces this metadata rather than inventing it from operation names. Internal metadata remains available to trusted assembly/registry while public capability output contains public operations only. An empty allowlist never authorizes an internal call.

## Owned product requirements

### R5-002 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Bootstrap establishes a local owner under explicit OS-level installation access. `installation.init` is available through both interfaces before normal authentication exists, but only in a one-time local bootstrap mode. `zatiti init` and `zatiti mcp serve --bootstrap` use the same initializer. Bootstrap checks the destination is uninitialized, acquires exclusive ownership, creates owner credentials in the selected secure store, and returns metadata only. It refuses reinitialization; it never exports an owner token into model context. Bootstrap mode ends after successful initialization and cannot be used as an alternate administration session.

### R5-003 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Normal CLI and MCP sessions select an explicitly provisioned local credential profile. The controller authenticates its credential and resolves a principal; a profile name, tool argument, MCP client name, socket access, or OS username alone does not establish application authority. MCP tool arguments cannot select a more privileged profile. Subprocesses do not receive the owner's credential environment by default. Same-user processes with access to the secure store remain within the OS trust boundary described in section 2.

### R5-004 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

An owner can delegate administration of named organizations, projects, workers, skills, and connections to a client-agent principal. This permits an agent to create and activate ordinary configuration within that existing envelope without a human confirming every edit. Requests outside the envelope produce a precise review or denial. Authority is evaluated using current grants and policy, never the proposed replacement policy.

### R5-005 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Permissions intersect principal scope, project/organization binding, worker/task scope where applicable, policy, active restrictions, resource availability, and required review. Delegation only narrows tool access, destinations, deadlines, and shared budgets. Explicit denials win. Unknown required conditions refuse admission. Worker self-modification and imported skill text cannot install grants.

### R5-006 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Policy supports standing authorized classes and exact-review classes. Default external publication, outbound messages, merges, deployment, credential-account substitution, and permission expansion require an eligible owner's decision unless the owner has explicitly established a narrower standing policy for that class. New policy is applied under old authority. Enabling automation, including an earned-autonomy promotion rule, is an explicit administrative act, not a competence score or model assertion.

### R5-007 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Workers and chiefs start with minimum permissions. The product supports increasing autonomy up to the operator's explicitly authorized ceilings. Chiefs propose promotions using recorded outcomes; deterministic rules evaluate independently established evidence against operator-approved requirements before activating a narrowly scoped grant. Without an applicable promotion rule, expansion requires the eligible owner's decision. No worker can approve its own evidence, rewrite its qualification criteria, or enlarge the ceiling that permits promotion.

### R5-008 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Qualifications bind capability, destination/scope, worker identity, relevant model/tool/skill versions, evidence window, and the promotion-rule version. Success in one capability does not grant unrelated powers. Relevant configuration changes trigger requalification; specified failures or incidents automatically restrict or demote the affected grant before further admission. Promotion and demotion produce durable events and user-visible explanations. Mandatory human-review classes remain mandatory unless the owner explicitly changes their governing policy under existing authority.

### R5-009 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Reviews declare whether a human is required. The same `review.decide` operation exists in CLI and MCP; both enforce principal kind, eligibility, current version, action digest, expiry, and optional separation of proposer and reviewer. An agent credential cannot satisfy a human-required review, even if it sends `approved_by_human: true` or runs the CLI instead. A human session can use either transport. V1 does not claim a model invocation through a human-authorized process proves physical human presence; installation owners are responsible for credential delegation.

### R5-010 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Pause, revoke, and cancel commit restrictive state immediately under authorized access, without a model call, configuration compilation, or spend reservation. Resume and expansion use normal authorization. A pause prevents future admissions; it cannot retract a request already transmitted or terminate an uncooperative external process by assertion.

### R10-002 (source section 10; primary owner effects)

External reads, model disclosure and mutations use registered contracts. Separate immutable **action** (exact intent), **operation** (logical effect) and **attempt** (physical invocation). An action binds account identity, destination, content/media hashes, timing, preconditions, and relevant configuration/tool versions. Reviews bind this digest. A changed action requires a new review where policy requires one.

### R10-003 (source section 10; primary owner effects)

Operation states are `prepared`, `awaiting_review`, `ready`, `executing`, `awaiting_confirmation`, `outcome_unknown`, `succeeded`, `failed`, and unsent terminal states `denied`, `expired`, `cancelled`. An operation is unsent only if no earlier attempt can still take effect. Provider acceptance and confirmed completion are distinct observations.

### R10-004 (source section 10; primary owner effects)

Execution uses three short local transactions around a network call:

### R10-005 (source section 10; primary owner effects)

1. **Admit:** validate current authority/review/preconditions, reserve all applicable budgets, create attempt and dispatch intent, and append evidence atomically.
2. **Claim:** the trusted sender consumes an attempt-bound claim after checking current generation, revocation and expiry. Workers never receive a reusable dispatch credential.
3. **Record:** after invocation, atomically store provider observations, outcome, settlement or retained uncertainty, and events. A failed record write does not authorize repeating the provider call.

### R10-006 (source section 10; primary owner effects)

Once dispatch is claimed, a crash or lost response can mean the provider acted. Recovery retains `outcome_unknown` and its reservation until supported evidence resolves it. An expired lease, timeout, cancellation, operator acknowledgement or eventually consistent not-found cannot establish non-execution. Revocation before claim prevents dispatch; revocation after claim cannot retract transmitted bytes.

### R10-007 (source section 10; primary owner effects)

Automatic mutation retries are disabled unless a qualified contract establishes request equivalence and safe idempotency within the provider's actual retention window, or authoritative non-execution. Each retry has current authorization and a separate attempt record. Disable hidden SDK retries that would bypass physical-call accounting. A failed retry cannot erase an earlier unknown attempt.

### R10-008 (source section 10; primary owner effects)

Reconciliation is a separately authorized, bounded read. Compensation and replacement are new linked operations with their own consequences and review, not a rewrite of the original outcome. Conflicting late evidence creates an explicit correction/dispute. The first GitHub adapter must bind repository, branch/head, exact change and relevant automation constraints; opening a pull request must not be treated as harmless when downstream automation can cause broader effects.
## Exact operation and dependency schemas

### `_configuration.snapshot` v1 — configuration / internal / query / local

Allowed internal callers: application, policy, tasks, execution, effects, memory, reviews, accounting, scheduling, messaging, connections, installation. Submission key: not required at this internal/query/bootstrap boundary.

Read current ancestry, effective bindings, worker/project and revision; no automatic descendant private data access.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"}},"required":["scope"]}
```
Output data schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"resource":{"$ref":"#/$defs/ScopeSnapshot"}},"required":["resource"]}

```

### `_policy.check` v1 — policy / internal / query / local

Allowed internal callers: application, configuration, tasks, execution, effects, memory, messaging, connections, installation, reviews, accounting. Submission key: not required at this internal/query/bootstrap boundary.

Intersect authenticated current grants, ancestry/bindings, task/worker scope, policy, restrictions and required conditions. Explicit deny wins; unknown required conditions fail closed. Check exact human review requirements without accepting user assertions.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"capability":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"action":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Action"},"candidate_digest":{"type":"string","pattern":"^[0-9a-f]{64}$"}},"required":["scope","capability"]}

```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"resource":{"$ref":"#/$defs/PolicyResult"}},"required":["resource"]}
```

### `_reviews.check` v1 — reviews / internal / query / local

Allowed internal callers: effects, configuration, policy, tasks. Submission key: not required at this internal/query/bootstrap boundary.

Recheck current eligible reviewer/grants, principal kind, expiry, version, proposer separation and exact action digest; false is not permission.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"action_digest":{"type":"string","pattern":"^[0-9a-f]{64}$"}},"required":["scope","action_digest"]}

Allowed internal callers: effects, configuration, policy. Submission key: not required at this internal/query/bootstrap boundary.

Create or inspect exact digest-bound review, retaining immutable history and eligibility constraints.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"action":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Action"},"requirement":{"$ref":"#/$defs/DecisionRequirement"}},"required":["scope","action","requirement"]}
```
Output data schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"resource":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Review"}},"required":["resource"]}
```

### `_tasks.snapshot` v1 — tasks / internal / query / local

Allowed internal callers: execution, effects, scheduling, memory, reviews, policy. Submission key: not required at this internal/query/bootstrap boundary.

Return current pinned contract and task scope, parent/root/dependency state; caller still obeys authority.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"}},"required":["scope","id"]}
```
Output data schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"resource":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Task"}},"required":["resource"]}
```

### `review.decide` v1 — reviews / public / mutation / local

CLI `zatiti review decide`; MCP `zatiti_review_decide`. Submission key: required.

Check current principal kind/eligibility, separation, expiry, version and exact digest; immutable decision. Agent claims of human approval are invalid input, not authority.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"expected_version":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":9223372036854775807},"action_digest":{"type":"string","pattern":"^[0-9a-f]{64}$"},"decision":{"type":"string","enum":["approve","reject"]},"reason":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192}},"required":["scope","id","expected_version","action_digest","decision","reason"]}
```
Output data schema:

```
Output data schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"items":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Review"},"maxItems":500}},"required":["items"]}
```

### Local schema definitions

The schemas above resolve exclusively against this embedded `$defs` object. Input objects reject additional properties except explicitly open schema/data fields. Field semantics are completed by the owned requirements and operation descriptions. Output `resource`, `items`, `draft`, `job`, etc. are literal keys. Pagination cursor lives in the common envelope.

## Named acceptance cases

Tests are implementation deliverables, not claims of already executed qualification. Retain expected/observed results, exact source/config/tool versions and failure evidence.

### Z04.stale_dependencies — Z04

Setup: A sealed plan pins dependencies, connection identity/validation, compiler/schema versions and a required decision.

Action: Change a pinned dependency or expire validation before applying; regenerate a changed plan and reuse the old decision.

Expected:

- The original plan cannot activate.
- Regeneration repins dependencies and requires renewal of any decision whose action digest changed.

### Z07.exact_action_changes — Z07

Setup: An approved action binds account, destination, content/media hashes, timing, preconditions, repository head and relevant versions.

Action: Independently change content, destination, timing, repository head or account before dispatch.

Expected:

- Every material change invalidates the original digest-bound approval where review is required.
- Dispatch waits for a new eligible decision over the exact changed preview.

### Z07.agent_impersonates_human — Z07

Setup: A pending review requires a human principal and an agent can call review.decide.

Action: Submit an approval with an approved_by_human assertion using both transports.

Expected:

- The agent credential cannot satisfy the review regardless of its payload or transport.
- No approval or protected dispatch is committed.

### Z07.reviewer_eligibility — Z07

Setup: Reviews include current version, expiry, proposer-separation and reviewer delegation restrictions.

Action: Decide using revoked or ineligible delegated credentials, an expired review, a stale version or the prohibited proposer.

Expected:

- Each ineligible decision is refused using current identity and policy.
- A permitted delegation is scoped and cannot bypass human-required or proposer-separation rules.

### Z07.transport_denial — Z07

Setup: Matching controller fixtures contain an action denied to an agent through MCP.

Action: Submit the identical decision using CLI with the equivalent agent principal; then use an eligible human principal through each interface.

Expected:

- CLI cannot bypass the MCP denial.
- An eligible human session can decide through either transport without any claim of proving physical human presence.

### Z11.manual_acceptance_label — Z11

Setup: A task contract permits eligible manual acceptance and has no passing automated result.

Action: Accept using the eligible principal, then inspect CLI/MCP results and evidence.

Expected:

- Acceptance remains explicitly labeled manual.
- The product never presents manual approval as successful independent automated verification.

### Z19.capability_promotion — Z19

Setup: A rule permits one exact capability/destination for one worker under specified model/tool/skill versions.

Action: Supply qualifying evidence and evaluate the rule.

Expected:

- Only the exact permitted capability/scope activates within the prior ceiling.
- Unrelated powers remain unavailable; durable events identify the evidence and rule version responsible.

### Z19.human_review_preserved — Z19

Setup: A worker earns a related capability but the governing policy still requires a human for a specific action class.

Action: Attempt that class under the new qualification.

Expected:

- The human-required decision remains mandatory.
- Only an explicitly authorized owner policy change under existing authority can change the mandatory class.

### Z21.exact_decision — Z21

Setup: Several organizations contain unresolved human-required actions and one stale reviewed action.

Action: Open Needs you, inspect an exact action card, approve one eligible action and try the stale action.

Expected:

- The card shows the actual action/destination/content/preconditions and acknowledged disposition with evidence links.
- The stale action cannot reuse approval; Needs you links to unresolved exact decisions.
- A chat assertion does not serve as approval or completion authority.

### Z21.capability_and_pause_cards — Z21

Setup: A worker has a proposed promotion and active work with a possibly transmitted effect.

Action: Inspect promotion details, pause or stop the relevant work and observe offline/online acknowledgement.

Expected:

- Autonomy is shown as exact capabilities and authority changes with evidence and rule/decision status, not a universal trust score.
- Pause/stop reports controller acknowledgement and unresolved external effects honestly; responsibility creation does not imply expanded authority.

### JOURNEY.engineering_cli — JOURNEY

Setup: A controlled repository has an explicit base head, policy, cooperative worker and independent sealed verifier.

Action: Through CLI, claim work, checkpoint, submit a patch and independent check evidence, then propose exact repository publication; also run failed-check and stale-head variants.

Expected:

- Successful acceptance is independently established and publication is governed by exact repository/branch/head/change/automation constraints.
- Failed checks block completion and stale head invalidates applicable review.
- Opening a pull request is not automatically treated as harmless when downstream automation broadens consequences.

### JOURNEY.engineering_mcp — JOURNEY

Setup: Use matching repository, worker, policy and sealed verification fixtures.

Action: Perform claim, checkpoint, patch/evidence submission and exact publication proposal entirely through MCP, including failed checks and stale head.

Expected:

- The same verified acceptance and protected-effect lifecycle is observed as through CLI.
- No arbitrary shell invocation exposed as an MCP substitute counts toward operation parity.

### JOURNEY.desktop_daily_work — JOURNEY

Setup: Launch the actual packaged desktop on a supported platform with a personal-chief conversation.

Action: Create marketing/engineering organizations and ordinary workers, assign a bounded task and ongoing responsibility, inspect result and memory, then handle an exact pending decision.

Expected:

- The visible hierarchy and work states match queried controller state rather than model narration.
- Memory scope/lineage and earned autonomy meet their own Z18/Z19 gates.
- Capture executed UI observations for setup and daily results/decisions; mocked view models alone are insufficient.

## Delivery

Implement production behavior and meaningful local tests within scope. Report files changed, commands actually run, observed results, unresolved dependency qualifications and contract defects. A missing dependency may use an exact local fake for development; production must return a named prerequisite/unsupported error instead of fake success. Integration owns shared dependency changes, real assembly, cross-package proving and landing. Do not advertise release or client/platform support from compilation alone.
