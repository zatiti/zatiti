# Implementation assignment: `internal/evidence`

Generated specification revision 1; source digest `c79b39e5ca496cd59114fdaa2c9dd3a36d7c9c0d3b4426bc131063f5cef22ca2`. This file is committed implementation context. Do not independently edit it. Everything required from the product specification and adjacent interfaces is embedded below; no RFC copy is required.

## Mission and scope

Own durable command replay, authorized event reads and receipts projected from actual evidence.

Write scope: **`internal/evidence/` only**, excluding this generated AGENTS.md. Go package name: `evidence`. Ownership kind: domain; integration wave: 2.

Allowed production imports from this repository: `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/contract`. Tests may use interfaces/fakes defined locally and, once available, storage-backed temporary fixtures; integration owns cross-package tests. No sibling raw SQL. No root dependency edits except the integration exception stated in its own brief.

## Implementation decisions and acceptance focus

Own evidence_commands/receipts/retention_pins; storage owns append-only transactional event/outbox records. Event/command outputs must authorize scope/principal and redact before persistence where possible. Keys bind principal/op/version/canonical request hash, same payload returns original complete/accepted/failed disposition, different content conflicts. Reserve identity and successful state in one writer transaction. Application records rejected mutation disposition separately after rollback with concurrency-safe same-key behavior. Retain keys >=30 days AND as long as any unresolved obligation depends on them. Event cursor scopes filters/principal and snapshot; authenticated opaque token expiry explicit, new snapshot required after retention gap. Storage.Events is trusted raw feed, not a bypass endpoint. Receipts link immutable decisions/provider observations/artifact digests, not worker assertion or log text. Arbitrary secret recognition/infallible history is not claimed; host/DB admin outside threat model. No pruning unresolved evidence to appear healthy.

Local proving focus: Duplicate command concurrency/hash conflict/lost ack/replay stale head, rollback+durable refusal, principal isolation, event cursor scope/expiry, state-event atomicity, secret redaction and unresolved retention.

## Incoming and outgoing boundaries

Incoming callers: application, installation, messaging, application (authenticated public operations).

Outgoing owner calls: none; use only declared Go dependency interfaces. Each exact input/output schema appears below. Calls retain current Unit/authority; owner allowlists are mandatory.

Expose `New(contract.Dependencies) (*Service,error)`; `*Service` implements `contract.Module` with Name `evidence`, owner-prefixed migrations, all owned descriptors, and strict dispatch. No calls/goroutines during construction. Implement optional authentication/LocalIO interfaces where specified in the common contract. Tables are private under `evidence_`; external callers rely only on methods and schemas.

### Imported package APIs and behavior

These briefs are embedded so you need not read a sibling prompt to discover its incoming API. Implement only your own package.

## Shared foundation contract

# Frozen implementation contract, revision 1

These decisions complete the product specification and bind every scope. Report contradictions with an affected-dependency list and proposed coordinated revision; do not change another owner's interface locally.

## Build and dependency decisions

Module `github.com/zatiti/zatiti`; language `go 1.26.0`; initial toolchain `go1.26.2`. Integration owns go.mod/go.sum. Domains import standard library and internal/contract, not sibling domains. Application composes owner methods through a checked in-process dispatcher: ordinary Go calls, not another server or scheduler.

Library families: Cobra CLI; official MCP Go SDK, handwritten adapter for MCP `2025-11-25`; Fyne v2 native Go desktop; modernc.org/sqlite. Mint is optional build-time tooling and cannot weaken contracts. Hosted provider v1: a specifically qualified OpenAI Responses endpoint/profile, with configured model and prices. Other compatible endpoints remain unavailable until qualified. GitHub uses documented REST over net/http, with mutation retries disabled. Serenity is a separate pinned service using public interfaces only. Integration must resolve exact dependency releases/commits, checksums, licenses and qualification commands in a lock report BEFORE dispatching dependent implementation. These are selected implementation families, not claims that upstream behavior has been qualified. No agent independently substitutes libraries, models, prices, accounts or Serenity APIs. Dependency resolution/qualification is an explicit foundation assignment.

## Shared Go declarations

The contract owner implements these exact declarations. Omitted function bodies are the implementation assignment, not production stubs. Public JSON uses snake_case. Schema-derived DTO names concatenate operation path segments in PascalCase plus Input/Output and live in the owning package. JSON integer => int64, UUID => contract.ID, timestamp => time.Time, optional scalar => pointer, array => slice, explicitly open JSON => json.RawMessage. Unknown fields are rejected.

The registry binds concrete input/output DTO types to descriptors and handlers using `Bind[I, O any](descriptor contract.Descriptor, fn func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. JSON decoding is strict and schema validation precedes execution. Internal cross-owner calls use the same schema-checked Invocation boundary to avoid sibling package imports. They retain the same Unit, actor, scope, generation and transaction; cannot mint authority; and are not exposed as public operations.

## Transaction and ownership rules

Each domain owns tables prefixed with its package name and `_`. Schema and migration bodies inside that namespace are package-private; no other package depends on their layout. Storage owns installation generation, migration metadata and `storage_events`. Evidence owns commands/receipts. Migration ordering is explicit in application assembly. All migrations run under exclusive installation ownership before serving. Cross-owner reads and changes use Ports.Call and the embedded internal schemas. Internal operations have a caller allowlist. The dispatcher detects recursive calls. Queries cannot invoke mutation descriptors. Public clients cannot supply Actor or Unit or invoke internal operations.

One controller, one ordered writer, WAL, foreign keys on every connection, synchronous FULL, busy timeout 5 seconds, consistent read snapshots. Database.Write performs ONE transaction callback attempt with no automatic callback retry. Busy exhaustion returns controller_unavailable/retryable. Unit is valid only inside its callback; no goroutines or retained handles. Unit.Emit appends state-correlated evidence to the storage outbox in the same transaction. Delivery is at least once and consumers deduplicate event IDs. No network/model calls, secret-store access, filesystem streaming or subprocess work inside a Unit. Stage bytes or local helper actions outside transactions, then publish metadata or reconciliation intent through owner methods.

Handler errors roll back the entire transaction. Persist a command refusal in a separate short transaction after rollback where necessary, retaining the original request identity. Query command IDs need not be durable. All mutations return durable command IDs; accepted responses must identify inspectable durable work. Output schemas describe Payload.Data, not the result envelope. Never leak SQL, tokens, provider raw responses or private paths through Fault.

Definition creates/updates/archive stage drafts, including schedules, responsibilities, policies and memory bindings. Only configuration.apply activates definitions. It validates owners' candidate slices, seals base revision/dependencies/requirements, and calls internal activate in the same transaction under old authority. Internal activate is admitted only from the compiler during exact plan application, not by a public flag. Public restrictive pause/revoke/cancel commits immediately without compilation or spending. Archive staging may immediately disable new admissions as an explicitly reported restrictive side effect; final removal waits for obligations.

## Effect and execution rules

Admit: current authorization, exact review/preconditions, all budget reservations, attempt/dispatch intent and evidence atomically. Claim: second transaction rechecks generation/restrictions/expiry and consumes the one-use claim. Invoke the adapter outside transactions. Record: third transaction stores observations, costs or retained uncertainty and events. Each physical call, including reconciliation and retries, has a distinct attempt. Reconciliation is an admitted bounded read and links to the original effect; it does not overwrite history. Internal jobs use explicitly provisioned scoped service identities plus current worker/task restrictions.

Once claimed, crash/timeout/cancel/lease expiry/operator acknowledgement/weak not-found cannot prove nonexecution. Preserve outcome_unknown and its reservation until authoritative evidence. Earlier unknown attempts survive later failures. Mutation SDK/HTTP retries are disabled. Even qualified idempotent retries need fresh authorization and physical-attempt evidence. Trusted adapters resolve credential references outside transactions; no public raw secrets or inherited owner credential environment. Fencing external workers blocks Zatiti mutations but cannot prove their processes stopped.

Task success needs independently established acceptance against pinned verifier code/version, sealed inputs and observations. Worker report/exit zero cannot set succeeded. Defaults: one concurrent attempt/worker, four/installation, 30 minutes/attempt, 100 model steps, eight children, delegation depth three, root deadline 24 hours. Configure explicit currency and finite spend limits before paid work. Amounts are int64 micro-units with checked overflow; rational rates use integer numerator/denominator and round reservations upward. Unknown/advisory usage and missing prices are not zero. Children share root and ancestor budgets.

## Wire conventions and limits

UUIDv4 for new identities; stable UUID references thereafter. SHA-256 lowercase hex digests. Versioned canonical JSON sorts keys, rejects duplicate keys/unknown fields, preserves exact integer values and semantic array order; schema-declared sets sort by stable identity. Preserve exact skill bytes. UTC RFC3339Nano timestamps and int64 versions >=1. Patches and snapshots are distinct; explicit delete only. Inert `extensions` alone permits namespaced extra keys. Scope is explicit and every referenced object is revalidated; no implicit global organization.

Default limits: JSON request 1 MiB; chunk 1 MiB decoded; artifact 256 MiB; skill archive 16 MiB compressed, 64 MiB expanded, 4096 entries, depth 32; list 50/max 200; read 1 MiB; redacted log record 8 KiB; event page 100/max 500; upload expiry 24 hours. Narrowing is allowed, increases require authorized configuration. Reject overflow and unsupported bounds.

Mutations require submission_key (1..128 printable ASCII) except one-time init. Bind principal, operation/version and canonical input hash. Retain >=30 days and through unresolved obligations. Replay identical input returns original disposition BEFORE stale-version validation; changed input => submission_conflict. Concurrent duplicates serialize. Recover lost acknowledgements by command lookup, not a new key. Resource updates require expected_version; apply requires base_revision and plan digest. Creation has no existing version. Opaque authenticated cursors bind principal/scope/filter/order/snapshot and expire explicitly with cursor_expired and snapshot_required=true. Event replay cannot silently omit a gap.

HTTP POST `/v1/operations/{operation_id}` uses the common request envelope. Local HTTP runs over a private Unix socket. Explicit remote desktop uses mutual TLS mapped to current application principals over the same operation contract, never remote MCP. Completed => HTTP 200; accepted => 202. Failed mapping: invalid_input 400, permission_denied 403, not_found 404, stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict/review_required/outcome_unknown/artifact_fault 409, cursor_expired 410, prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported/verification_failed 422, controller_unavailable 503, internal_error 500. Domain failures always include the result envelope.

CLI completed/accepted => exit 0; invalid_input 2; permission_denied/review_required 3; stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict 4; prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported 5; controller_unavailable/outcome_unknown 6; other failures 1. CLI --json emits one envelope to stdout, diagnostics stderr, no implicit prompts. MCP structuredContent is the full envelope, text is equivalent JSON, failed => isError true, malformed protocol => protocol error. Dot-separated operation IDs map to CLI tokens and `zatiti_` MCP names. Exceptions: installation.init => `zatiti init` / `zatiti_installation_init`; capabilities.list => `zatiti capabilities` / `zatiti_capabilities`. Lifecycle steps are individual tools. Tool input never selects a credential profile or accepts raw secrets/unrestricted server paths.

## Completion policy

Write only within the assigned root. Do not edit this prompt, siblings, shared contracts, root dependencies or external acceptance inputs. Implement exact fake dependencies locally; do not return invented production success for unavailable prerequisites. Use controlled providers, deterministic clocks and synthetic fixtures. Preserve expected/observed results and failure evidence. Package tests prove local properties; actual subprocess parity, crash recovery, desktop and adapter qualification prove integration. Z01-Z21 and first-release journeys on macOS/Linux must pass before a release is claimed.

## Local IO, authentication, jobs and verification seams

These additional declarations are part of the SAME frozen contract package (using imports already shown). Implementing an interface does not permit calling it inside a Unit except where the signature explicitly takes Unit/Reader.

```go
type Authenticator interface {
    Authenticate(context.Context, Reader, []byte) (Actor, error)
    AuthenticateCertificate(context.Context, Reader, Digest) (Actor, error)
}
type IOPlan struct {
    ID ID
    Owner string
    Invocation Invocation
    Actor Actor
    Scope Scope
    Generation int64
    ExpectedVersions map[ID]Version
    Prepared json.RawMessage
}
type IOResult struct { Data json.RawMessage; Fault *Fault }
type LocalIO interface {
    Prepare(context.Context, Unit, Invocation) (IOPlan, error)
    Perform(context.Context, IOPlan) (IOResult, error)
    Finish(context.Context, Unit, IOPlan, IOResult) (Payload, error)
}
// Request is the exact VerificationRequest JSON schema embedded in the prompt.
type Verification struct { Request json.RawMessage }
// Document is the exact VerificationResult schema, including independently
// observed checks, pinned identity, task/attempt and staged artifact handoff.
type VerificationResult struct { Document json.RawMessage }
type Verifier interface {
    Verify(context.Context, Verification) (VerificationResult, error)
}
type VerifierDependencies struct { Clock Clock; Blobs BlobStore }
```

Identity Service also implements Authenticator. Application receives this interface explicitly in New; it uses a dedicated read snapshot and never reads identity-owned tables itself. Only the byte-slice credential boundary carries secret authentication material, never Invocation JSON. Zero sensitive buffers after use where practical; no logging. Certificate authentication resolves a preprovisioned credential reference and follows the same current principal/revocation rules.

Artifacts, skills, connections and installation Services also implement LocalIO. The registry detects this interface at assembly and routes ONLY registered local IO operations through Prepare/Perform/Finish: artifact.upload.chunk/finish/cancel/read/export; skill.import; connection.setup.begin/complete/cancel; installation.init/backup/restore. LocalIO handles local bounded files, secure helpers and backup work, never unadmitted provider/model calls. Prepare strictly validates input, versions, identity and authority and records replayable local intent under IOPlan.ID; Perform receives that exact trusted in-memory plan outside transactions, resolves opaque staging/helper references, and returns metadata; Finish rechecks authority/versions/generation and commits result/evidence. IOPlan is never public, accepted from an agent or stored with secrets. Prepared/Data JSON must use the operation's declared schemas plus private owner-local metadata, which no other package reads. No cross-owner business protocol may hide in those private fields. Perform must support safe replay of local staging/publication by plan ID, or preserve an inspectable failed/unknown local obligation. A synchronous read does not return bytes to client until final authorization check. New raw provider writes always use effects, not this interface.

For synchronous local IO mutations, persist command identity plus accepted internal pending disposition at Prepare, then replace pending disposition once at Finish. Concurrent same-key calls join/inspect that same in-progress command and never run duplicate Perform. The controller can recover abandoned local intents using the execution job API. Async backup/export uses the same interface with an inspectable job returned immediately. The artifact.upload.chunk endpoint has a 2 MiB encoded request cap (all other ordinary JSON requests 1 MiB), allowing the specified 1 MiB decoded chunk plus envelope.

Execution owns shared durable jobs (execution_jobs), distinct from runs and physical effects. `_execution.job.create` stores the original owner/operation/input and idempotent source identity; public job.get inspects any authorized job. Controller lists pending jobs, claims generation-bound ownership, invokes the named LocalIO owner outside transactions through its exact plan, and records result/obligation. Network jobs first prepare effects and wait on their recorded outcomes. `_execution.job.record` stores result data matching the originating operation's explicit completion_schema and links actual artifact/operation evidence. Never mark a job succeeded merely because its physical request was accepted.

Tasks calls `_execution.enqueue` with ready pinned task inside the same transaction; execution creates one run for task/version and returns it. `_tasks.ready` also exposes a bounded recovery scan. Execution's verifier constructor is `NewVerifier(contract.VerifierDependencies) (contract.Verifier,error)`. Verify executes outside Unit and returns actual independently established observations under the pinned accepted profile; `_execution.verification.record` rechecks attempt/task/version before changing task state. A forged worker-provided VerificationResult is never accepted through public report. Concrete context/adapter/verification payload schemas are included in relevant prompts.

Administrative effects that have no task use their command/operation ID as an accountable admission root; no fictional worker/task or fabricated task foreign key is required. Accounting skips absent scope dimensions but always reserves installation and present organization ancestors/project limits. Task effects additionally share root_task_id. A profile without enforceable charge bounds cannot claim a hard cap.

Typed handler bindings return `contract.Outcome[O]` so accepted results and page cursors survive typed registration. The frozen Bind signature is `Bind[I, O any](contract.Descriptor, func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. Errors carry Fault and roll back, while accepted/completed status and cursor come from Outcome.

Assembly order: application.NewPorts() returns an unbound *PortRouter; For(owner string) returns an owner-bound contract.Ports without domain calls; construct identity and all other modules with those ports; registry.New(modules); application.New(db, registry, identityAuthenticator, clock, ids); router.Bind(app) exactly once; start serving only after Bind. PortRouter exposes `For(string) contract.Ports` and `Bind(*Application) error`, rejects pre-bind invocation, and never allows a domain to change its bound caller identity. Registry also implements Module for its own capabilities methods. Constructor execution must not query peers or start goroutines.

All native BlobStore objects are encrypted at rest (including public-classification content), because Stage has no classification argument. Metadata publication sets encrypted=true; classification separately governs disclosure. Controller records the raw adapter observation and cost disposition durably first, then publishes StagedOutput bytes outside Unit, then commits artifact metadata and normalized owner callbacks through an outbox consumer. Publication failure is a visible artifact obligation and blocks task/job acceptance; it does not erase a confirmed provider observation or authorize resending. The adapter cannot mint artifact IDs.

Entrypoint assembly owns platform.Acquire -> storage.Open -> Migrate -> Database.StartGeneration, exactly once before controller/server admission. Pass the held contract.Ownership into controller.New; controller never acquires a second lock or advances generation again. Ownership.Lost closes when ownership is lost/released; stop admission immediately. Generation is a persisted local-controller fence, not distributed locking. The installation lock is retained until controller shutdown and DB close.

Remote TLS additionally validates the certificate chain and maps the SHA-256 certificate SPKI fingerprint through application.AuthenticateCertificate(ctx,Digest), which delegates to identity Authenticator.AuthenticateCertificate on a read snapshot. Only a verified TLS peer can enter that API; operation input cannot supply the fingerprint. Store certificate fingerprints as identity-owned authentication metadata on an explicitly provisioned credential reference. If a bearer credential is also supplied, its principal must match the verified certificate principal. No self-asserted certificate name, profile name or fingerprint header grants authority.

Every async operation declares completion_schema separately from its immediate Job response. job.get returns that schema as Job.result only when established; pending jobs omit result. Local IO mutations that may be recovered asynchronously accept either their completed resource output or `{job: Job}` in the descriptor output schema. Bootstrap remains synchronous under its exclusive one-time lock. No unspecified job kind may execute: _execution.job.create requires a registered completion_schema or a specifically registered private local-intent recovery contract.

Evidence retains the complete original result envelope for command replay, including fault message/details/retryability and cursor; projections of status/data/error_code must agree with Command.result. `_evidence.command.finish` takes that exact result. A replay cannot reconstruct a different error or lose an accepted job reference. ScopeRequired lists installation_id where input scope is required; resource-specific organization/project/worker conditions are enforced by the owned operation schemas and current referenced-resource validation, never inferred from a profile name.

Descriptor.Callers carries the exact catalog internal caller allowlist into runtime registration; application enforces this metadata rather than inventing it from operation names. Internal metadata remains available to trusted assembly/registry while public capability output contains public operations only. An empty allowlist never authorizes an internal call.

## Owned product requirements

### R8.4-002 (source section 8.4; primary owner contract)

```json
{
  "schema": "zatiti.result/v1",
  "command_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001",
  "status": "completed",
  "data": {"draft_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000002", "version": 1},
  "error": null,
  "next_cursor": null
}
```

### R8.4-003 (source section 8.4; primary owner contract)

`status` is `completed`, `accepted`, or `failed`. Completion of a command such as task creation or approval is not completion of the task or external effect it refers to. Data carries resource IDs, actual lifecycle state, versions, relevant artifact/event references and next actions. Accepted long operations include an inspectable task/job reference. Stable error codes include `invalid_input`, `not_found`, `permission_denied`, `stale_version`, `review_required`, `prerequisite_missing`, `external_action_required`, `budget_unavailable`, `capability_unsupported`, `controller_unavailable`, and `outcome_unknown`.

### R8.4-004 (source section 8.4; primary owner contract)

CLI exits are 0 for completed/accepted commands, 2 for input errors, 3 for denied/review-required access, 4 for stale/conflicting state, 5 for missing prerequisites or unsupported capability, 6 for unavailable/unknown outcomes, and 1 for other failures. Machine clients inspect the envelope as well as the exit code. A pending task is not a CLI failure. An unknown external outcome is not a successful write.

### R8.4-005 (source section 8.4; primary owner contract)

Mutating requests require a caller-generated submission key except during initial bootstrap, where the uninitialized installation lock supplies uniqueness. The controller binds keys to principal, operation ID/version and canonical request hash. Reuse with identical input returns the original durable command disposition; changed input refuses. A lost acknowledgement is recovered through command lookup, not a new key. Keep keys at least 30 days and through all unresolved obligations. MCP JSON-RPC request IDs are not submission keys.

### R8.4-006 (source section 8.4; primary owner contract)

Resource changes require an expected version or base revision. Pagination uses stable opaque cursors and bounded page sizes; list/get/event operations return the same scope and freshness in both transports. MCP resources and CLI watch are optional presentation conveniences over replayable event reads. Clients encountering an expired event cursor fetch a new snapshot and resume; no silent gap is presented as complete history.

### R8.4-007 (source section 8.4; primary owner contract)

Large content uses bounded chunk upload and byte-range read operations in both interfaces. The client chooses local file locations; MCP never accepts an unrestricted server filesystem path. Backup creation returns an opaque backup artifact, and restore consumes an uploaded backup reference in a quiesced maintenance mode. The same local owner operation can enter maintenance through CLI or MCP; it does not require a transport-specific admin endpoint.

### R8.4-008 (source section 8.4; primary owner contract)

Starting/stopping a client process, shell completion, help formatting and MCP protocol negotiation are transport mechanics rather than product operations. Installation initialization, health, credentials, backup and restore remain product operations and require parity. The parity suite enumerates the registry and rejects unmapped operations or unequal authorization, state, error, pagination, or event behavior.

### R11-002 (source section 11; primary owner accounting)

Use exact integer micro-units of an explicit currency and rational rate arithmetic. Reserve enforceable costs atomically across installation, organization, project, worker and root task using a stable lock/update order. Inference, evaluation, retries and delegated tasks share relevant limits. Record spent, reserved, estimated and unknown amounts separately. Missing prices or advisory external usage are not zero cost. Hard caps are claimed only where the selected provider contract bounds charges.

### R11-003 (source section 11; primary owner accounting)

Budgets need finite defaults. Proposed defaults are one concurrent attempt per worker, four per installation, a 30-minute attempt, 100 model steps, eight children, delegation depth three, and a 24-hour root deadline. Installations explicitly select currency and spending limits before paid work; the shipped default refuses paid execution until configured. No fixed provider price is embedded in the RFC.

### R11-004 (source section 11; primary owner accounting)

Commands, configuration revisions, state transitions, decisions, provider observations and artifact digests produce durable evidence. Receipts are projections over these records. Hash integrity is not a claim of an incorruptible log or independent external custody. A host/database administrator is outside the evidence threat model; external signing/anchoring is future work.

### R11-005 (source section 11; primary owner accounting)

Backups use the database's consistent backup mechanism and a pinned artifact manifest; copying a live database file without its consistency requirements is not a backup contract. Encrypt backups, preserve key-recovery prerequisites separately, and verify before advertising completion. Restore acquires exclusive maintenance ownership and starts paused. Preserve unresolved operations, reservations, credentials' revocation state and retained command identities. Reconcile pending dispatches before resuming. A database rewind cannot undo provider effects.

### R11-006 (source section 11; primary owner accounting)

Bound input sizes, archive expansion, log payloads, lists and event replay. Redact credentials before persistence and logging where possible; arbitrary secret recognition is not claimed. Retention never removes unresolved obligations to make the system appear healthy. Disk pressure pauses new artifact-producing work; it does not discard unknown effects. A doctor report names missing prerequisites and current execution/profile limitations without exposing secrets.
## Exact operation and dependency schemas

### `_evidence.command.begin` v1 — evidence / internal / mutation / local

Allowed internal callers: application. Submission key: not required at this internal/query/bootstrap boundary.

Atomically acquire command identity or return original disposition; changed hash conflicts. Retention >=30 days plus obligations.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"principal_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"operation":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"operation_version":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":9223372036854775807},"submission_key":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"request_digest":{"type":"string","pattern":"^[0-9a-f]{64}$"}},"required":["principal_id","operation","operation_version","submission_key","request_digest"]}
```
Output data schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"command_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"existing":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Command"}},"required":["command_id"]}
```

### `_evidence.command.finish` v1 — evidence / internal / mutation / local

Allowed internal callers: application. Submission key: not required at this internal/query/bootstrap boundary.

Persist handler disposition in same transaction as its state/events; remember denial separately after rollback when required. Retain complete original result envelope including Fault message/details/retryability and cursor; replays return it exactly. Command ID must match result.command_id.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"command_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"result":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Result"}},"required":["command_id","result"]}
```
Output data schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"resource":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Command"}},"required":["resource"]}
```

### `_evidence.snapshot` v1 — evidence / internal / query / local

Allowed internal callers: application, installation, messaging. Submission key: not required at this internal/query/bootstrap boundary.

Get current event checkpoint with consistent scoped read; no private events through cursor position.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"}},"required":["scope"]}
```
Output data schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"last_sequence":{"type":"integer","minimum":0,"maximum":9223372036854775807}},"required":["last_sequence"]}

```
Output data schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"items":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Event"},"maxItems":500}},"required":["items"]}
```

### Local schema definitions

The schemas above resolve exclusively against this embedded `$defs` object. Input objects reject additional properties except explicitly open schema/data fields. Field semantics are completed by the owned requirements and operation descriptions. Output `resource`, `items`, `draft`, `job`, etc. are literal keys. Pagination cursor lives in the common envelope.

```json
{"$defs":{"Command":{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"principal_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"operation":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"operation_version":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":9223372036854775807},"submission_key":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"request_digest":{"type":"string","pattern":"^[0-9a-f]{64}$"},"status":{"type":"string","enum":["completed","accepted","failed"]},"data":{"type":"object","description":"Inert JSON data bounded by the enclosing size limit; never executable authority."},"error_code":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"result":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Result"}},"required":["id","principal_id","operation","operation_version","submission_key","request_digest","status","data","result"]},"Event":{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"sequence":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":9223372036854775807},"at":{"type":"string","format":"date-time"},"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"kind":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"resource_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"resource_version":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":9223372036854775807},"data":{"type":"object","description":"Inert JSON data bounded by the enclosing size limit; never executable authority."}},"required":["id","sequence","at","scope","kind","resource_id","resource_version","data"]},"Fault":{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"code":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"message":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"retryable":{"type":"boolean"},"details":{"type":"object","description":"Inert JSON data bounded by the enclosing size limit; never executable authority."}},"required":["code","message","retryable"]},"Result":{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"schema":{"const":"zatiti.result/v1"},"command_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"status":{"type":"string","enum":["completed","accepted","failed"]},"data":{"anyOf":[{"type":"object","description":"Inert JSON data bounded by the enclosing size limit; never executable authority."},{"type":"null"}]},"error":{"anyOf":[{"$ref":"#/$defs/Fault"},{"type":"null"}]},"next_cursor":{"anyOf":[{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["schema","command_id","status","data","error","next_cursor"]},"Scope":{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"installation_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"organization_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"project_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"worker_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"task_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"}},"required":["installation_id"]}}}

## Named acceptance cases

Tests are implementation deliverables, not claims of already executed qualification. Retain expected/observed results, exact source/config/tool versions and failure evidence.

### Z04.submission_replay — Z04

Setup: An apply has committed but its acknowledgement is lost.

Action: Retry with the same principal, operation version, submission key and canonical input; then reuse that key with different input.

Expected:

- Identical retry returns the original durable command disposition without another revision or event.
- Changed input is refused; command identity survives restart and remains retained through unresolved obligations and at least 30 days.

### Z08.delayed_confirmation — Z08

Setup: An operation awaits confirmation or is outcome_unknown and the provider initially returns eventually consistent not-found.

Action: Reconcile, then deliver delayed authoritative success; separately deliver contradictory late evidence.

Expected:

- Non-authoritative not-found does not establish nonexecution.
- Authoritative success settles according to evidence; contradictory evidence creates a visible correction or dispute instead of rewriting history.

### Z10.lost_claim_ack — Z10

Setup: A cooperative claim commits and its network acknowledgement is dropped.

Action: Repeat the claim with the same submission identity and inspect the command.

Expected:

- The claimant recovers the original attempt/lease disposition.
- No duplicate current owner or replacement attempt is created merely because the acknowledgement was lost.

### Z11.worker_assertion — Z11

Setup: A worker submits plausible narrative success and self-generated tests.

Action: Report completion without independently accepted check evidence.

Expected:

- Worker assertions are recorded as observations rather than proof.
- Independent verification or an authorized explicitly manual acceptance is still required.

### Z11.manual_acceptance_label — Z11

Setup: A task contract permits eligible manual acceptance and has no passing automated result.

Action: Accept using the eligible principal, then inspect CLI/MCP results and evidence.

Expected:

- Acceptance remains explicitly labeled manual.
- The product never presents manual approval as successful independent automated verification.

### Z13.secret_surfaces — Z13

Setup: Synthetic uniquely marked secrets exist in owner/provider secure stores and setup helpers.

Action: Exercise setup, rotation, failure logging, CLI/MCP output, organization export, artifact metadata and diagnostics.

Expected:

- No planted raw credential is exposed in tool arguments, ordinary flags, CLI/MCP results, logs or organization exports.
- Setup exposes challenge references and metadata; subprocesses do not inherit owner credential environment by default.

### Z14.atomic_state_event — Z14

Setup: Fault injection can fail event/outbox insertion or state persistence inside a shared transaction.

Action: Perform representative configuration, task and effect transitions with each failure injected.

Expected:

- Neither state without its required event nor an event without its state becomes committed.
- Recovery reads durable records and does not infer success from log text.

### Z15.export_exclusions — Z15

Setup: An organization owns credentials, completed tasks, unknown operations and run history.

Action: Create an organization export and separately request run history export and encrypted backup.

Expected:

- Organization export includes versioned definitions but excludes secret values, principal credentials, task history and mutable operation state.
- History export and backup have distinct contracts; required runtime obligations remain in state and backup.

### Z16.disconnect_command_lookup — Z16

Setup: A mutation commits immediately before its transport connection drops.

Action: Reconnect, look up the command by its original submission key and retry only with that key.

Expected:

- The original disposition is recovered without another business mutation or event.
- JSON-RPC request IDs are not treated as durable submission keys.

### Z16.cursor_expiry — Z16

Setup: An event cursor falls outside the retained replay window while scoped state continues changing.

Action: Resume event reading with that cursor.

Expected:

- A named cursor-expiry result requires a fresh authorized snapshot and new replay position.
- The client never presents an unseen event gap as complete history; both transports preserve equivalent scope and freshness.

### Z17.chief_replacement — Z17

Setup: An organization has a designated chief, shared memory, responsibilities, pending decisions and history.

Action: Replace its chief using an authorized exact configuration plan.

Expected:

- The organization keeps its identity, memory, obligations and history.
- Exactly one active chief remains; replacement does not silently grant private memories or excess authority.

### Z18.chief_promotion_provenance — Z18

Setup: A chief has explicit source read/disclosure and destination curate/write permissions under finite budgets.

Action: Promote a suitable claim from worker or child-organization memory into shared memory.

Expected:

- The new destination claim links source brain, claim/version, supporting artifacts, curator identity and redaction.
- Promotion is scoped admitted work; the copied claim is not independent corroboration of its source.

### Z19.unsupported_evidence — Z19

Setup: An owner-approved promotion rule requires independently established results in a specified evidence window.

Action: Submit model assertions, unverified worker tests, stale evidence or provenance-free memory claims as proof.

Expected:

- Insufficient evidence is rejected with an inspectable explanation.
- No grant activates solely from competence narration or a remembered judgment.

### QUALIFICATION.release_evidence — QUALIFICATION

Setup: All named acceptance cases have executable harness identities and retained case results.

Action: Assemble the release report and audit skipped, planned, failed and passing runs against Z01-Z21 and required journeys.

Expected:

- Each required passing case records source/config/tool versions, expected and observed results, and retained failure evidence from fault tests.
- Planned tests, skipped suites, golden files alone and a zero process exit do not satisfy release gates.
- README and installation/client/platform claims match executed evidence; public fixtures use synthetic identities and contain no private operational data.

## Delivery

Implement production behavior and meaningful local tests within scope. Report files changed, commands actually run, observed results, unresolved dependency qualifications and contract defects. A missing dependency may use an exact local fake for development; production must return a named prerequisite/unsupported error instead of fake success. Integration owns shared dependency changes, real assembly, cross-package proving and landing. Do not advertise release or client/platform support from compilation alone.
