# Implementation assignment: `internal/scheduling`

Generated specification revision 1; source digest `c79b39e5ca496cd59114fdaa2c9dd3a36d7c9c0d3b4426bc131063f5cef22ca2`. This file is committed implementation context. Do not independently edit it. Everything required from the product specification and adjacent interfaces is embedded below; no RFC copy is required.

## Mission and scope

Own durable schedules, responsibility reasoning cycles, occurrence identities and wake conditions.

Write scope: **`internal/scheduling/` only**, excluding this generated AGENTS.md. Go package name: `scheduling`. Ownership kind: domain; integration wave: 2.

Allowed production imports from this repository: `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/contract`. Tests may use interfaces/fakes defined locally and, once available, storage-backed temporary fixtures; integration owns cross-package tests. No sibling raw SQL. No root dependency edits except the integration exception stated in its own brief.

## Implementation decisions and acceptance focus

Own scheduling_definitions/responsibilities/wakes/occurrences/cycles. Scheduler is driven only by controller; no goroutine scheduler in service constructor or external fleet. Cron syntax is five-field minute/hour/day-of-month/month/day-of-week with IANA time zone; when both day fields restricted, use OR semantics. Repeated local time during DST uses UTC occurrence identity, admit each defined distinct instant once; nonexistent spring-forward local occurrence skipped. Default misfire coalesces one newest eligible missed occurrence within catch_up_seconds; older misses recorded skipped. Empty catch-up window means no catch-up. Occurrence key is schedule ID + pinned template version + UTC instant (or durable event ID for event wake). Recheck pause/cancel/reply condition at transactional admission; authenticated explicit reply events only, no external chat ingestion. Persist task creation, occurrence key and next wake atomically. Responsibilities define signals/triggers, finite per-cycle and aggregate limits, minimum reconsideration interval, pause/escalation conditions and durable outputs even on idle cycles. No arbitrary unbounded polling; controller bounded tick uses injected clock. Pause responsibility independently of unrelated work. Safe mailbox/reply wake admission is deduplicated.

Local proving focus: DST repeats/gaps, duplicate polls/restart, catch-up coalescing, cancellation/reply at wake, durable next-wake, bounded idle cycles, aggregate cost, responsibility-only pause.

## Incoming and outgoing boundaries

Incoming callers: application, configuration, controller, execution, application (authenticated public operations).

Outgoing owner calls: `_configuration.stage`, `_configuration.snapshot`, `_accounting.reserve`, `_accounting.inspect`, `_tasks.create`, `_tasks.snapshot`, `_tasks.transition`, `_messaging.admit`, `_messaging.pending`, `_execution.enqueue`. Each exact input/output schema appears below. Calls retain current Unit/authority; owner allowlists are mandatory.

Expose `New(contract.Dependencies) (*Service,error)`; `*Service` implements `contract.Module` with Name `scheduling`, owner-prefixed migrations, all owned descriptors, and strict dispatch. No calls/goroutines during construction. Implement optional authentication/LocalIO interfaces where specified in the common contract. Tables are private under `scheduling_`; external callers rely only on methods and schemas.

### Imported package APIs and behavior

These briefs are embedded so you need not read a sibling prompt to discover its incoming API. Implement only your own package.

## Shared foundation contract

# Frozen implementation contract, revision 1

These decisions complete the product specification and bind every scope. Report contradictions with an affected-dependency list and proposed coordinated revision; do not change another owner's interface locally.

## Build and dependency decisions

Module `github.com/zatiti/zatiti`; language `go 1.26.0`; initial toolchain `go1.26.2`. Integration owns go.mod/go.sum. Domains import standard library and internal/contract, not sibling domains. Application composes owner methods through a checked in-process dispatcher: ordinary Go calls, not another server or scheduler.

Library families: Cobra CLI; official MCP Go SDK, handwritten adapter for MCP `2025-11-25`; Fyne v2 native Go desktop; modernc.org/sqlite. Mint is optional build-time tooling and cannot weaken contracts. Hosted provider v1: a specifically qualified OpenAI Responses endpoint/profile, with configured model and prices. Other compatible endpoints remain unavailable until qualified. GitHub uses documented REST over net/http, with mutation retries disabled. Serenity is a separate pinned service using public interfaces only. Integration must resolve exact dependency releases/commits, checksums, licenses and qualification commands in a lock report BEFORE dispatching dependent implementation. These are selected implementation families, not claims that upstream behavior has been qualified. No agent independently substitutes libraries, models, prices, accounts or Serenity APIs. Dependency resolution/qualification is an explicit foundation assignment.

## Shared Go declarations

The contract owner implements these exact declarations. Omitted function bodies are the implementation assignment, not production stubs. Public JSON uses snake_case. Schema-derived DTO names concatenate operation path segments in PascalCase plus Input/Output and live in the owning package. JSON integer => int64, UUID => contract.ID, timestamp => time.Time, optional scalar => pointer, array => slice, explicitly open JSON => json.RawMessage. Unknown fields are rejected.

The registry binds concrete input/output DTO types to descriptors and handlers using `Bind[I, O any](descriptor contract.Descriptor, fn func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. JSON decoding is strict and schema validation precedes execution. Internal cross-owner calls use the same schema-checked Invocation boundary to avoid sibling package imports. They retain the same Unit, actor, scope, generation and transaction; cannot mint authority; and are not exposed as public operations.

## Transaction and ownership rules

Each domain owns tables prefixed with its package name and `_`. Schema and migration bodies inside that namespace are package-private; no other package depends on their layout. Storage owns installation generation, migration metadata and `storage_events`. Evidence owns commands/receipts. Migration ordering is explicit in application assembly. All migrations run under exclusive installation ownership before serving. Cross-owner reads and changes use Ports.Call and the embedded internal schemas. Internal operations have a caller allowlist. The dispatcher detects recursive calls. Queries cannot invoke mutation descriptors. Public clients cannot supply Actor or Unit or invoke internal operations.

One controller, one ordered writer, WAL, foreign keys on every connection, synchronous FULL, busy timeout 5 seconds, consistent read snapshots. Database.Write performs ONE transaction callback attempt with no automatic callback retry. Busy exhaustion returns controller_unavailable/retryable. Unit is valid only inside its callback; no goroutines or retained handles. Unit.Emit appends state-correlated evidence to the storage outbox in the same transaction. Delivery is at least once and consumers deduplicate event IDs. No network/model calls, secret-store access, filesystem streaming or subprocess work inside a Unit. Stage bytes or local helper actions outside transactions, then publish metadata or reconciliation intent through owner methods.

Handler errors roll back the entire transaction. Persist a command refusal in a separate short transaction after rollback where necessary, retaining the original request identity. Query command IDs need not be durable. All mutations return durable command IDs; accepted responses must identify inspectable durable work. Output schemas describe Payload.Data, not the result envelope. Never leak SQL, tokens, provider raw responses or private paths through Fault.

Definition creates/updates/archive stage drafts, including schedules, responsibilities, policies and memory bindings. Only configuration.apply activates definitions. It validates owners' candidate slices, seals base revision/dependencies/requirements, and calls internal activate in the same transaction under old authority. Internal activate is admitted only from the compiler during exact plan application, not by a public flag. Public restrictive pause/revoke/cancel commits immediately without compilation or spending. Archive staging may immediately disable new admissions as an explicitly reported restrictive side effect; final removal waits for obligations.

## Effect and execution rules

Admit: current authorization, exact review/preconditions, all budget reservations, attempt/dispatch intent and evidence atomically. Claim: second transaction rechecks generation/restrictions/expiry and consumes the one-use claim. Invoke the adapter outside transactions. Record: third transaction stores observations, costs or retained uncertainty and events. Each physical call, including reconciliation and retries, has a distinct attempt. Reconciliation is an admitted bounded read and links to the original effect; it does not overwrite history. Internal jobs use explicitly provisioned scoped service identities plus current worker/task restrictions.

Once claimed, crash/timeout/cancel/lease expiry/operator acknowledgement/weak not-found cannot prove nonexecution. Preserve outcome_unknown and its reservation until authoritative evidence. Earlier unknown attempts survive later failures. Mutation SDK/HTTP retries are disabled. Even qualified idempotent retries need fresh authorization and physical-attempt evidence. Trusted adapters resolve credential references outside transactions; no public raw secrets or inherited owner credential environment. Fencing external workers blocks Zatiti mutations but cannot prove their processes stopped.

Task success needs independently established acceptance against pinned verifier code/version, sealed inputs and observations. Worker report/exit zero cannot set succeeded. Defaults: one concurrent attempt/worker, four/installation, 30 minutes/attempt, 100 model steps, eight children, delegation depth three, root deadline 24 hours. Configure explicit currency and finite spend limits before paid work. Amounts are int64 micro-units with checked overflow; rational rates use integer numerator/denominator and round reservations upward. Unknown/advisory usage and missing prices are not zero. Children share root and ancestor budgets.

## Wire conventions and limits

UUIDv4 for new identities; stable UUID references thereafter. SHA-256 lowercase hex digests. Versioned canonical JSON sorts keys, rejects duplicate keys/unknown fields, preserves exact integer values and semantic array order; schema-declared sets sort by stable identity. Preserve exact skill bytes. UTC RFC3339Nano timestamps and int64 versions >=1. Patches and snapshots are distinct; explicit delete only. Inert `extensions` alone permits namespaced extra keys. Scope is explicit and every referenced object is revalidated; no implicit global organization.

Default limits: JSON request 1 MiB; chunk 1 MiB decoded; artifact 256 MiB; skill archive 16 MiB compressed, 64 MiB expanded, 4096 entries, depth 32; list 50/max 200; read 1 MiB; redacted log record 8 KiB; event page 100/max 500; upload expiry 24 hours. Narrowing is allowed, increases require authorized configuration. Reject overflow and unsupported bounds.

Mutations require submission_key (1..128 printable ASCII) except one-time init. Bind principal, operation/version and canonical input hash. Retain >=30 days and through unresolved obligations. Replay identical input returns original disposition BEFORE stale-version validation; changed input => submission_conflict. Concurrent duplicates serialize. Recover lost acknowledgements by command lookup, not a new key. Resource updates require expected_version; apply requires base_revision and plan digest. Creation has no existing version. Opaque authenticated cursors bind principal/scope/filter/order/snapshot and expire explicitly with cursor_expired and snapshot_required=true. Event replay cannot silently omit a gap.

HTTP POST `/v1/operations/{operation_id}` uses the common request envelope. Local HTTP runs over a private Unix socket. Explicit remote desktop uses mutual TLS mapped to current application principals over the same operation contract, never remote MCP. Completed => HTTP 200; accepted => 202. Failed mapping: invalid_input 400, permission_denied 403, not_found 404, stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict/review_required/outcome_unknown/artifact_fault 409, cursor_expired 410, prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported/verification_failed 422, controller_unavailable 503, internal_error 500. Domain failures always include the result envelope.

CLI completed/accepted => exit 0; invalid_input 2; permission_denied/review_required 3; stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict 4; prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported 5; controller_unavailable/outcome_unknown 6; other failures 1. CLI --json emits one envelope to stdout, diagnostics stderr, no implicit prompts. MCP structuredContent is the full envelope, text is equivalent JSON, failed => isError true, malformed protocol => protocol error. Dot-separated operation IDs map to CLI tokens and `zatiti_` MCP names. Exceptions: installation.init => `zatiti init` / `zatiti_installation_init`; capabilities.list => `zatiti capabilities` / `zatiti_capabilities`. Lifecycle steps are individual tools. Tool input never selects a credential profile or accepts raw secrets/unrestricted server paths.

## Completion policy

Write only within the assigned root. Do not edit this prompt, siblings, shared contracts, root dependencies or external acceptance inputs. Implement exact fake dependencies locally; do not return invented production success for unavailable prerequisites. Use controlled providers, deterministic clocks and synthetic fixtures. Preserve expected/observed results and failure evidence. Package tests prove local properties; actual subprocess parity, crash recovery, desktop and adapter qualification prove integration. Z01-Z21 and first-release journeys on macOS/Linux must pass before a release is claimed.

## Local IO, authentication, jobs and verification seams

These additional declarations are part of the SAME frozen contract package (using imports already shown). Implementing an interface does not permit calling it inside a Unit except where the signature explicitly takes Unit/Reader.

```go
type Authenticator interface {
    Authenticate(context.Context, Reader, []byte) (Actor, error)
    AuthenticateCertificate(context.Context, Reader, Digest) (Actor, error)
}
type IOPlan struct {
    ID ID
    Owner string
    Invocation Invocation
    Actor Actor
    Scope Scope
    Generation int64
    ExpectedVersions map[ID]Version
    Prepared json.RawMessage
}
type IOResult struct { Data json.RawMessage; Fault *Fault }
type LocalIO interface {
    Prepare(context.Context, Unit, Invocation) (IOPlan, error)
    Perform(context.Context, IOPlan) (IOResult, error)
    Finish(context.Context, Unit, IOPlan, IOResult) (Payload, error)
}
// Request is the exact VerificationRequest JSON schema embedded in the prompt.
type Verification struct { Request json.RawMessage }
// Document is the exact VerificationResult schema, including independently
// observed checks, pinned identity, task/attempt and staged artifact handoff.
type VerificationResult struct { Document json.RawMessage }
type Verifier interface {
    Verify(context.Context, Verification) (VerificationResult, error)
}
type VerifierDependencies struct { Clock Clock; Blobs BlobStore }
```

Identity Service also implements Authenticator. Application receives this interface explicitly in New; it uses a dedicated read snapshot and never reads identity-owned tables itself. Only the byte-slice credential boundary carries secret authentication material, never Invocation JSON. Zero sensitive buffers after use where practical; no logging. Certificate authentication resolves a preprovisioned credential reference and follows the same current principal/revocation rules.

Artifacts, skills, connections and installation Services also implement LocalIO. The registry detects this interface at assembly and routes ONLY registered local IO operations through Prepare/Perform/Finish: artifact.upload.chunk/finish/cancel/read/export; skill.import; connection.setup.begin/complete/cancel; installation.init/backup/restore. LocalIO handles local bounded files, secure helpers and backup work, never unadmitted provider/model calls. Prepare strictly validates input, versions, identity and authority and records replayable local intent under IOPlan.ID; Perform receives that exact trusted in-memory plan outside transactions, resolves opaque staging/helper references, and returns metadata; Finish rechecks authority/versions/generation and commits result/evidence. IOPlan is never public, accepted from an agent or stored with secrets. Prepared/Data JSON must use the operation's declared schemas plus private owner-local metadata, which no other package reads. No cross-owner business protocol may hide in those private fields. Perform must support safe replay of local staging/publication by plan ID, or preserve an inspectable failed/unknown local obligation. A synchronous read does not return bytes to client until final authorization check. New raw provider writes always use effects, not this interface.

For synchronous local IO mutations, persist command identity plus accepted internal pending disposition at Prepare, then replace pending disposition once at Finish. Concurrent same-key calls join/inspect that same in-progress command and never run duplicate Perform. The controller can recover abandoned local intents using the execution job API. Async backup/export uses the same interface with an inspectable job returned immediately. The artifact.upload.chunk endpoint has a 2 MiB encoded request cap (all other ordinary JSON requests 1 MiB), allowing the specified 1 MiB decoded chunk plus envelope.

Execution owns shared durable jobs (execution_jobs), distinct from runs and physical effects. `_execution.job.create` stores the original owner/operation/input and idempotent source identity; public job.get inspects any authorized job. Controller lists pending jobs, claims generation-bound ownership, invokes the named LocalIO owner outside transactions through its exact plan, and records result/obligation. Network jobs first prepare effects and wait on their recorded outcomes. `_execution.job.record` stores result data matching the originating operation's explicit completion_schema and links actual artifact/operation evidence. Never mark a job succeeded merely because its physical request was accepted.

Tasks calls `_execution.enqueue` with ready pinned task inside the same transaction; execution creates one run for task/version and returns it. `_tasks.ready` also exposes a bounded recovery scan. Execution's verifier constructor is `NewVerifier(contract.VerifierDependencies) (contract.Verifier,error)`. Verify executes outside Unit and returns actual independently established observations under the pinned accepted profile; `_execution.verification.record` rechecks attempt/task/version before changing task state. A forged worker-provided VerificationResult is never accepted through public report. Concrete context/adapter/verification payload schemas are included in relevant prompts.

Administrative effects that have no task use their command/operation ID as an accountable admission root; no fictional worker/task or fabricated task foreign key is required. Accounting skips absent scope dimensions but always reserves installation and present organization ancestors/project limits. Task effects additionally share root_task_id. A profile without enforceable charge bounds cannot claim a hard cap.

Typed handler bindings return `contract.Outcome[O]` so accepted results and page cursors survive typed registration. The frozen Bind signature is `Bind[I, O any](contract.Descriptor, func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. Errors carry Fault and roll back, while accepted/completed status and cursor come from Outcome.

Assembly order: application.NewPorts() returns an unbound *PortRouter; For(owner string) returns an owner-bound contract.Ports without domain calls; construct identity and all other modules with those ports; registry.New(modules); application.New(db, registry, identityAuthenticator, clock, ids); router.Bind(app) exactly once; start serving only after Bind. PortRouter exposes `For(string) contract.Ports` and `Bind(*Application) error`, rejects pre-bind invocation, and never allows a domain to change its bound caller identity. Registry also implements Module for its own capabilities methods. Constructor execution must not query peers or start goroutines.

All native BlobStore objects are encrypted at rest (including public-classification content), because Stage has no classification argument. Metadata publication sets encrypted=true; classification separately governs disclosure. Controller records the raw adapter observation and cost disposition durably first, then publishes StagedOutput bytes outside Unit, then commits artifact metadata and normalized owner callbacks through an outbox consumer. Publication failure is a visible artifact obligation and blocks task/job acceptance; it does not erase a confirmed provider observation or authorize resending. The adapter cannot mint artifact IDs.

Entrypoint assembly owns platform.Acquire -> storage.Open -> Migrate -> Database.StartGeneration, exactly once before controller/server admission. Pass the held contract.Ownership into controller.New; controller never acquires a second lock or advances generation again. Ownership.Lost closes when ownership is lost/released; stop admission immediately. Generation is a persisted local-controller fence, not distributed locking. The installation lock is retained until controller shutdown and DB close.

Remote TLS additionally validates the certificate chain and maps the SHA-256 certificate SPKI fingerprint through application.AuthenticateCertificate(ctx,Digest), which delegates to identity Authenticator.AuthenticateCertificate on a read snapshot. Only a verified TLS peer can enter that API; operation input cannot supply the fingerprint. Store certificate fingerprints as identity-owned authentication metadata on an explicitly provisioned credential reference. If a bearer credential is also supplied, its principal must match the verified certificate principal. No self-asserted certificate name, profile name or fingerprint header grants authority.

Every async operation declares completion_schema separately from its immediate Job response. job.get returns that schema as Job.result only when established; pending jobs omit result. Local IO mutations that may be recovered asynchronously accept either their completed resource output or `{job: Job}` in the descriptor output schema. Bootstrap remains synchronous under its exclusive one-time lock. No unspecified job kind may execute: _execution.job.create requires a registered completion_schema or a specifically registered private local-intent recovery contract.

Evidence retains the complete original result envelope for command replay, including fault message/details/retryability and cursor; projections of status/data/error_code must agree with Command.result. `_evidence.command.finish` takes that exact result. A replay cannot reconstruct a different error or lose an accepted job reference. ScopeRequired lists installation_id where input scope is required; resource-specific organization/project/worker conditions are enforced by the owned operation schemas and current referenced-resource validation, never inferred from a profile name.

Descriptor.Callers carries the exact catalog internal caller allowlist into runtime registration; application enforces this metadata rather than inventing it from operation names. Internal metadata remains available to trusted assembly/registry while public capability output contains public operations only. An empty allowlist never authorizes an internal call.

## Owned product requirements

### R9-002 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Tasks pin an accountable principal, organization/project, assigned worker, outcome, input artifacts, required outputs, acceptance contract and resource envelope. Acceptance identifies verifier code/version, sealed inputs, expected observations and whether independent verification or authorized manual acceptance is required. Workers may propose contracts, but cannot replace their task's accepted verifier during execution.

### R9-003 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Task states are `draft`, `ready`, `running`, `waiting`, `verifying`, `succeeded`, `failed`, and `cancelled`. Waiting includes explicit dependencies, human decisions, prerequisites and recovery owners. Cancellation records intent first; terminal cancellation requires owned execution to stop or be conclusively fenced, and unresolved effects remain visible separately. A worker report and process exit do not independently set `succeeded`.

### R9-004 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Runs pin effective configuration and input versions. Each run attempt has one executor, lease, generation, heartbeat, resource reservation and output disposition. Retrying creates a new attempt; it cannot silently change the accepted task contract. A failed verification cannot release dependents whose acceptance requires verified success. A manual acceptance decision remains labeled manual rather than represented as automated proof.

### R9-005 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Zatiti owns the model loop used by chiefs and ongoing responsibilities. Specialist tasks may use external harness adapters under the same task and effect contracts. Adapters declare supported capabilities, including checkpointing, continuation, interruption, context capture, and cost reporting; unsupported guarantees fail explicitly rather than being inferred from a harness name. An external harness does not own a second copy of Zatiti's task graph.

### R9-006 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

The initial executors are:

### R9-007 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

- **Hosted loop:** a configured provider adapter runs bounded model steps with only the declared tools and credential broker. Model calls, disclosure and costs follow the same scope and accounting rules.
- **Cooperative external worker:** an authorized client claims work, receives pinned task context and lease identity, sends heartbeats/checkpoints, proposes governed effects, and submits artifacts and completion observations. Zatiti verifies the submitted result independently. The worker's external shell, network and billing remain advisory unless a separately qualified execution boundary contains them.

### R9-008 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Claim/heartbeat/report APIs bind the worker, attempt and generation. Concurrent claims cannot create two current owners. Lease expiry fences future Zatiti mutations but does not prove the old process stopped; a replacement waits for explicit recovery disposition of conflicting resources and possible external effects. A caller cannot report for another attempt or turn a stale result into current completion.

### R9-009 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Schedules reference pinned task templates, explicit time zones, occurrence keys, and misfire rules. Default missed occurrences coalesce once within a configured catch-up window; pause disables admission. Daylight-saving changes and repeated polling cannot duplicate an admitted occurrence. Conditions such as cancellation or a recorded reply are checked transactionally at wake. v1 reply conditions use explicit authenticated events; external chat-channel intake is a later adapter.

### R9-010 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Child tasks inherit intersected authority, project data, deadlines and root budgets. Parent completion criteria explicitly state which child outcomes are required. Delegation depth, child count, concurrency, planner steps and wall time are finite. No nested fleet scheduler may claim ownership of the same Zatiti task graph.

### R9-011 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Responsibilities support both durable schedules/event subscriptions and repeated reasoning. A responsibility records what outcome to pursue, what signals to inspect, when to reconsider, its finite per-cycle and aggregate spending limits, and conditions for pausing or escalating. Reasoning cycles may discover and propose useful work even without a new external event. Every cycle is a bounded admitted run with a durable next-wake decision, a minimum reconsideration interval, and accountable outputs; an idle loop cannot spend indefinitely or silently create unbounded tasks. The operator can pause a responsibility without cancelling unrelated work.

### R9-012 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Agent messages use durable mailboxes with sender, recipient, organization scope, task references, and stable message identity. Receipt is acknowledged only after durable target admission; redelivery deduplicates by identity. Running workers receive admitted messages at a safe step boundary, and idle workers can be resumed. Coordination messages and unsolicited context remain untrusted observations, never replacement authority. Direct user instructions and chief assignments converge on versioned tasks so concurrent conversations cannot silently overwrite responsibility.

### R9-013 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

For the owned loop, every model-visible input must be reconstructable from persisted context: user messages, tool definitions and results, memory excerpts, effective instructions, and injected agent messages. Persist the request context before model dispatch and the protected effect intent before tool dispatch. Compaction retains lineage to its source context. External executors declare the limits of their context capture; Zatiti must not advertise exact transcript replay when an adapter cannot supply it.

### Local schema definitions

The schemas above resolve exclusively against this embedded `$defs` object. Input objects reject additional properties except explicitly open schema/data fields.

## Named acceptance cases

Tests are implementation deliverables, not claims of already executed qualification. Retain expected/observed results, exact source/config/tool versions and failure evidence.

### Z10.duplicate_schedule_claim — Z10

Setup: One scheduled occurrence is due and multiple polls and cooperative claimants race.

Action: Poll repeatedly across timezone/DST boundaries and concurrently claim the same task.

Expected:

- The occurrence key admits at most one occurrence according to the configured misfire rule.
- Only one current attempt owner, lease and generation are committed.

### Z10.cancelled_wake — Z10

Setup: A task is durably waiting for a timer or authenticated reply event.

Action: Commit cancellation or a qualifying reply concurrently with wake evaluation.

Expected:

- Wake conditions are checked transactionally.
- Cancelled work is not readmitted; a reply already recorded does not cause duplicate or obsolete wake work.

### Z20.scheduled_cycles — Z20

Setup: A responsibility specifies scheduled/event triggers, finite cycle/root limits, timezone and catch-up window.

Action: Trigger normal, missed and duplicated occurrences and an authenticated event.

Expected:

- Each admitted cycle is bounded and linked to the responsibility; repeated polls/events do not duplicate task admission.
- Default missed occurrences coalesce once within the configured window and pauses disable new admission.

### Z20.reasoning_cycles — Z20

Setup: An active responsibility permits repeated reasoning without new external events and has a minimum reconsideration interval.

Action: Run a reasoning cycle that proposes useful work, then inspect its next wake and outputs.

Expected:

- The cycle is an admitted bounded run with accountable outputs and a persisted next-wake decision.
- Proposed work converges on versioned tasks and stays within task-count, scope and spending limits.

### Z20.bounded_idle_spend — Z20

Setup: A responsibility repeatedly finds no useful work and has finite per-cycle/aggregate funds and a minimum interval.

Action: Advance the deterministic clock through many potential cycles.

Expected:

- The minimum interval prevents a tight reasoning loop.
- Aggregate exhaustion or pause conditions stop new spend; idle reasoning cannot create unlimited tasks or spend indefinitely.

### Z20.restart_at_wake — Z20

Setup: A durable responsibility wake is due and admission has a controllable transaction boundary.

Action: Crash immediately before and after wake admission, then restart.

Expected:

- Recovery preserves the correct next-wake decision and occurrence identity.
- Exactly the intended bounded cycle is admitted without loss or duplication.

### Z20.responsibility_pause — Z20

Setup: Two responsibilities have active/queued work and only one is selected for pause.

Action: Pause that responsibility and race its next wake.

Expected:

- Restrictive state commits immediately and prevents new admission for that responsibility.
- Unrelated work is not cancelled; already transmitted effects and unresolved outcomes remain visible.

### Z21.delegate_work — Z21

Setup: A real desktop session has personal, marketing and engineering chiefs plus ordinary workers.

Action: Assign a bounded task and an ongoing responsibility, delegate work, then inspect a produced result.

Expected:

- The UI exposes durable task/responsibility state, required outputs and acceptance evidence outside message narration.
- Failed checks cannot be represented as successful completion; the responsibility remains independently pausable.

### Z21.capability_and_pause_cards — Z21

Setup: A worker has a proposed promotion and active work with a possibly transmitted effect.

Action: Inspect promotion details, pause or stop the relevant work and observe offline/online acknowledgement.

Expected:

- Autonomy is shown as exact capabilities and authority changes with evidence and rule/decision status, not a universal trust score.
- Pause/stop reports controller acknowledgement and unresolved external effects honestly; responsibility creation does not imply expanded authority.

### JOURNEY.desktop_daily_work — JOURNEY

Setup: Launch the actual packaged desktop on a supported platform with a personal-chief conversation.

Action: Create marketing/engineering organizations and ordinary workers, assign a bounded task and ongoing responsibility, inspect result and memory, then handle an exact pending decision.

Expected:

- The visible hierarchy and work states match queried controller state rather than model narration.
- Memory scope/lineage and earned autonomy meet their own Z18/Z19 gates.
- Capture executed UI observations for setup and daily results/decisions; mocked view models alone are insufficient.

## Delivery

Implement production behavior and meaningful local tests within scope. Report files changed, commands actually run, observed results, unresolved dependency qualifications and contract defects. A missing dependency may use an exact local fake for development; production must return a named prerequisite/unsupported error instead of fake success. Integration owns shared dependency changes, real assembly, cross-package proving and landing. Do not advertise release or client/platform support from compilation alone.
