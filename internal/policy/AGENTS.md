# Implementation assignment: `internal/policy`

Generated specification revision 1; source digest `c79b39e5ca496cd59114fdaa2c9dd3a36d7c9c0d3b4426bc131063f5cef22ca2`. This file is committed implementation context. Do not independently edit it. Everything required from the product specification and adjacent interfaces is embedded below; no RFC copy is required.

## Mission and scope

Own deterministic authority intersection, standing/exact-review policy and earned autonomy.

Write scope: **`internal/policy/` only**, excluding this generated AGENTS.md. Go package name: `policy`. Ownership kind: domain; integration wave: 2.

Allowed production imports from this repository: `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/contract`. Tests may use interfaces/fakes defined locally and, once available, storage-backed temporary fixtures; integration owns cross-package tests. No sibling raw SQL. No root dependency edits except the integration exception stated in its own brief.

## Implementation decisions and acceptance focus

Own policy_definitions/restrictions/promotion_rules/qualifications and immutable evaluation evidence links. Policy rules are interpreted bounded declarative conditions only. Supported condition keys: max_cost (Money), required_classification (enum), not_before/expires_at (UTC), required_tool_version (Ref), required_worker_id (ID), required_review (bool); reject unknown executable conditions. Intersect current principal grants, hierarchy ceilings, project/binding, worker/task envelope, restrictions and current resources. Explicit deny wins; missing required condition refuses admission. Default publication/outbound messages/merge/deploy/account substitution/permission expansion require eligible owner review absent narrower prior standing policy. Expansion always under old policy. Promotions bind capability/destination/worker/model/tool/skill versions/window/rule version and independently established evidence; workers cannot approve own evidence, change evaluator/criteria or widen ceiling. Permit automatic narrow grant only under previously approved rule. Relevant changes invalidate affected qualification before new admission; incidents immediately restrict/demote before continued work. Human-required classes persist until owner explicitly changes governing rule. Model summaries and memory judgments are evidence candidates, never policy authority.

Local proving focus: Deny intersection, missing condition, self-grant, old/new policy race, precise human-required class, qualification evidence independence/version binding, auto demotion before claim, parent ceiling.

## Incoming and outgoing boundaries

Incoming callers: accounting, application, configuration, connections, effects, execution, installation, memory, messaging, reviews, skills, tasks, application (authenticated public operations).

Outgoing owner calls: `_identity.authority`, `_identity.restrict`, `_identity.promote`, `_configuration.stage`, `_configuration.snapshot`, `_reviews.ensure`, `_reviews.check`, `_accounting.inspect`, `_tasks.snapshot`. Each exact input/output schema appears below. Calls retain current Unit/authority; owner allowlists are mandatory.

Expose `New(contract.Dependencies) (*Service,error)`; `*Service` implements `contract.Module` with Name `policy`, owner-prefixed migrations, all owned descriptors, and strict dispatch. No calls/goroutines during construction. Implement optional authentication/LocalIO interfaces where specified in the common contract. Tables are private under `policy_`; external callers rely only on methods and schemas.

### Imported package APIs and behavior

These briefs are embedded so you need not read a sibling prompt to discover its incoming API. Implement only your own package.

## Shared foundation contract

# Frozen implementation contract, revision 1

These decisions complete the product specification and bind every scope. Report contradictions with an affected-dependency list and proposed coordinated revision; do not change another owner's interface locally.

## Build and dependency decisions

Module `github.com/zatiti/zatiti`; language `go 1.26.0`; initial toolchain `go1.26.2`. Integration owns go.mod/go.sum. Domains import standard library and internal/contract, not sibling domains. Application composes owner methods through a checked in-process dispatcher: ordinary Go calls, not another server or scheduler.

Library families: Cobra CLI; official MCP Go SDK, handwritten adapter for MCP `2025-11-25`; Fyne v2 native Go desktop; modernc.org/sqlite. Mint is optional build-time tooling and cannot weaken contracts. Hosted provider v1: a specifically qualified OpenAI Responses endpoint/profile, with configured model and prices. Other compatible endpoints remain unavailable until qualified. GitHub uses documented REST over net/http, with mutation retries disabled. Serenity is a separate pinned service using public interfaces only. Integration must resolve exact dependency releases/commits, checksums, licenses and qualification commands in a lock report BEFORE dispatching dependent implementation. These are selected implementation families, not claims that upstream behavior has been qualified. No agent independently substitutes libraries, models, prices, accounts or Serenity APIs. Dependency resolution/qualification is an explicit foundation assignment.

## Shared Go declarations

The contract owner implements these exact declarations. Omitted function bodies are the implementation assignment, not production stubs. Public JSON uses snake_case. Schema-derived DTO names concatenate operation path segments in PascalCase plus Input/Output and live in the owning package. JSON integer => int64, UUID => contract.ID, timestamp => time.Time, optional scalar => pointer, array => slice, explicitly open JSON => json.RawMessage. Unknown fields are rejected.

The registry binds concrete input/output DTO types to descriptors and handlers using `Bind[I, O any](descriptor contract.Descriptor, fn func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. JSON decoding is strict and schema validation precedes execution. Internal cross-owner calls use the same schema-checked Invocation boundary to avoid sibling package imports. They retain the same Unit, actor, scope, generation and transaction; cannot mint authority; and are not exposed as public operations.

## Transaction and ownership rules

Each domain owns tables prefixed with its package name and `_`. Schema and migration bodies inside that namespace are package-private; no other package depends on their layout. Storage owns installation generation, migration metadata and `storage_events`. Evidence owns commands/receipts. Migration ordering is explicit in application assembly. All migrations run under exclusive installation ownership before serving. Cross-owner reads and changes use Ports.Call and the embedded internal schemas. Internal operations have a caller allowlist. The dispatcher detects recursive calls. Queries cannot invoke mutation descriptors. Public clients cannot supply Actor or Unit or invoke internal operations.

One controller, one ordered writer, WAL, foreign keys on every connection, synchronous FULL, busy timeout 5 seconds, consistent read snapshots. Database.Write performs ONE transaction callback attempt with no automatic callback retry. Busy exhaustion returns controller_unavailable/retryable. Unit is valid only inside its callback; no goroutines or retained handles. Unit.Emit appends state-correlated evidence to the storage outbox in the same transaction. Delivery is at least once and consumers deduplicate event IDs. No network/model calls, secret-store access, filesystem streaming or subprocess work inside a Unit. Stage bytes or local helper actions outside transactions, then publish metadata or reconciliation intent through owner methods.

Handler errors roll back the entire transaction. Persist a command refusal in a separate short transaction after rollback where necessary, retaining the original request identity. Query command IDs need not be durable. All mutations return durable command IDs; accepted responses must identify inspectable durable work. Output schemas describe Payload.Data, not the result envelope. Never leak SQL, tokens, provider raw responses or private paths through Fault.

Definition creates/updates/archive stage drafts, including schedules, responsibilities, policies and memory bindings. Only configuration.apply activates definitions. It validates owners' candidate slices, seals base revision/dependencies/requirements, and calls internal activate in the same transaction under old authority. Internal activate is admitted only from the compiler during exact plan application, not by a public flag. Public restrictive pause/revoke/cancel commits immediately without compilation or spending. Archive staging may immediately disable new admissions as an explicitly reported restrictive side effect; final removal waits for obligations.

## Effect and execution rules

Admit: current authorization, exact review/preconditions, all budget reservations, attempt/dispatch intent and evidence atomically. Claim: second transaction rechecks generation/restrictions/expiry and consumes the one-use claim. Invoke the adapter outside transactions. Record: third transaction stores observations, costs or retained uncertainty and events. Each physical call, including reconciliation and retries, has a distinct attempt. Reconciliation is an admitted bounded read and links to the original effect; it does not overwrite history. Internal jobs use explicitly provisioned scoped service identities plus current worker/task restrictions.

Once claimed, crash/timeout/cancel/lease expiry/operator acknowledgement/weak not-found cannot prove nonexecution. Preserve outcome_unknown and its reservation until authoritative evidence. Earlier unknown attempts survive later failures. Mutation SDK/HTTP retries are disabled. Even qualified idempotent retries need fresh authorization and physical-attempt evidence. Trusted adapters resolve credential references outside transactions; no public raw secrets or inherited owner credential environment. Fencing external workers blocks Zatiti mutations but cannot prove their processes stopped.

Task success needs independently established acceptance against pinned verifier code/version, sealed inputs and observations. Worker report/exit zero cannot set succeeded. Defaults: one concurrent attempt/worker, four/installation, 30 minutes/attempt, 100 model steps, eight children, delegation depth three, root deadline 24 hours. Configure explicit currency and finite spend limits before paid work. Amounts are int64 micro-units with checked overflow; rational rates use integer numerator/denominator and round reservations upward. Unknown/advisory usage and missing prices are not zero. Children share root and ancestor budgets.

## Wire conventions and limits

UUIDv4 for new identities; stable UUID references thereafter. SHA-256 lowercase hex digests. Versioned canonical JSON sorts keys, rejects duplicate keys/unknown fields, preserves exact integer values and semantic array order; schema-declared sets sort by stable identity. Preserve exact skill bytes. UTC RFC3339Nano timestamps and int64 versions >=1. Patches and snapshots are distinct; explicit delete only. Inert `extensions` alone permits namespaced extra keys. Scope is explicit and every referenced object is revalidated; no implicit global organization.

Default limits: JSON request 1 MiB; chunk 1 MiB decoded; artifact 256 MiB; skill archive 16 MiB compressed, 64 MiB expanded, 4096 entries, depth 32; list 50/max 200; read 1 MiB; redacted log record 8 KiB; event page 100/max 500; upload expiry 24 hours. Narrowing is allowed, increases require authorized configuration. Reject overflow and unsupported bounds.

Mutations require submission_key (1..128 printable ASCII) except one-time init. Bind principal, operation/version and canonical input hash. Retain >=30 days and through unresolved obligations. Replay identical input returns original disposition BEFORE stale-version validation; changed input => submission_conflict. Concurrent duplicates serialize. Recover lost acknowledgements by command lookup, not a new key. Resource updates require expected_version; apply requires base_revision and plan digest. Creation has no existing version. Opaque authenticated cursors bind principal/scope/filter/order/snapshot and expire explicitly with cursor_expired and snapshot_required=true. Event replay cannot silently omit a gap.

HTTP POST `/v1/operations/{operation_id}` uses the common request envelope. Local HTTP runs over a private Unix socket. Explicit remote desktop uses mutual TLS mapped to current application principals over the same operation contract, never remote MCP. Completed => HTTP 200; accepted => 202. Failed mapping: invalid_input 400, permission_denied 403, not_found 404, stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict/review_required/outcome_unknown/artifact_fault 409, cursor_expired 410, prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported/verification_failed 422, controller_unavailable 503, internal_error 500. Domain failures always include the result envelope.

CLI completed/accepted => exit 0; invalid_input 2; permission_denied/review_required 3; stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict 4; prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported 5; controller_unavailable/outcome_unknown 6; other failures 1. CLI --json emits one envelope to stdout, diagnostics stderr, no implicit prompts. MCP structuredContent is the full envelope, text is equivalent JSON, failed => isError true, malformed protocol => protocol error. Dot-separated operation IDs map to CLI tokens and `zatiti_` MCP names. Exceptions: installation.init => `zatiti init` / `zatiti_installation_init`; capabilities.list => `zatiti capabilities` / `zatiti_capabilities`. Lifecycle steps are individual tools. Tool input never selects a credential profile or accepts raw secrets/unrestricted server paths.

## Completion policy

Write only within the assigned root. Do not edit this prompt, siblings, shared contracts, root dependencies or external acceptance inputs. Implement exact fake dependencies locally; do not return invented production success for unavailable prerequisites. Use controlled providers, deterministic clocks and synthetic fixtures. Preserve expected/observed results and failure evidence. Package tests prove local properties; actual subprocess parity, crash recovery, desktop and adapter qualification prove integration. Z01-Z21 and first-release journeys on macOS/Linux must pass before a release is claimed.

## Local IO, authentication, jobs and verification seams

These additional declarations are part of the SAME frozen contract package (using imports already shown). Implementing an interface does not permit calling it inside a Unit except where the signature explicitly takes Unit/Reader.

```go
type Authenticator interface {
    Authenticate(context.Context, Reader, []byte) (Actor, error)
    AuthenticateCertificate(context.Context, Reader, Digest) (Actor, error)
}
type IOPlan struct {
    ID ID
    Owner string
    Invocation Invocation
    Actor Actor
    Scope Scope
    Generation int64
    ExpectedVersions map[ID]Version
    Prepared json.RawMessage
}
type IOResult struct { Data json.RawMessage; Fault *Fault }
type LocalIO interface {
    Prepare(context.Context, Unit, Invocation) (IOPlan, error)
    Perform(context.Context, IOPlan) (IOResult, error)
    Finish(context.Context, Unit, IOPlan, IOResult) (Payload, error)
}
// Request is the exact VerificationRequest JSON schema embedded in the prompt.
type Verification struct { Request json.RawMessage }
// Document is the exact VerificationResult schema, including independently
// observed checks, pinned identity, task/attempt and staged artifact handoff.
type VerificationResult struct { Document json.RawMessage }
type Verifier interface {
    Verify(context.Context, Verification) (VerificationResult, error)
}
type VerifierDependencies struct { Clock Clock; Blobs BlobStore }
```

Identity Service also implements Authenticator. Application receives this interface explicitly in New; it uses a dedicated read snapshot and never reads identity-owned tables itself. Only the byte-slice credential boundary carries secret authentication material, never Invocation JSON. Zero sensitive buffers after use where practical; no logging. Certificate authentication resolves a preprovisioned credential reference and follows the same current principal/revocation rules.

Artifacts, skills, connections and installation Services also implement LocalIO. The registry detects this interface at assembly and routes ONLY registered local IO operations through Prepare/Perform/Finish: artifact.upload.chunk/finish/cancel/read/export; skill.import; connection.setup.begin/complete/cancel; installation.init/backup/restore. LocalIO handles local bounded files, secure helpers and backup work, never unadmitted provider/model calls. Prepare strictly validates input, versions, identity and authority and records replayable local intent under IOPlan.ID; Perform receives that exact trusted in-memory plan outside transactions, resolves opaque staging/helper references, and returns metadata; Finish rechecks authority/versions/generation and commits result/evidence. IOPlan is never public, accepted from an agent or stored with secrets. Prepared/Data JSON must use the operation's declared schemas plus private owner-local metadata, which no other package reads. No cross-owner business protocol may hide in those private fields. Perform must support safe replay of local staging/publication by plan ID, or preserve an inspectable failed/unknown local obligation. A synchronous read does not return bytes to client until final authorization check. New raw provider writes always use effects, not this interface.

For synchronous local IO mutations, persist command identity plus accepted internal pending disposition at Prepare, then replace pending disposition once at Finish. Concurrent same-key calls join/inspect that same in-progress command and never run duplicate Perform. The controller can recover abandoned local intents using the execution job API. Async backup/export uses the same interface with an inspectable job returned immediately. The artifact.upload.chunk endpoint has a 2 MiB encoded request cap (all other ordinary JSON requests 1 MiB), allowing the specified 1 MiB decoded chunk plus envelope.

Execution owns shared durable jobs (execution_jobs), distinct from runs and physical effects. `_execution.job.create` stores the original owner/operation/input and idempotent source identity; public job.get inspects any authorized job. Controller lists pending jobs, claims generation-bound ownership, invokes the named LocalIO owner outside transactions through its exact plan, and records result/obligation. Network jobs first prepare effects and wait on their recorded outcomes. `_execution.job.record` stores result data matching the originating operation's explicit completion_schema and links actual artifact/operation evidence. Never mark a job succeeded merely because its physical request was accepted.

Tasks calls `_execution.enqueue` with ready pinned task inside the same transaction; execution creates one run for task/version and returns it. `_tasks.ready` also exposes a bounded recovery scan. Execution's verifier constructor is `NewVerifier(contract.VerifierDependencies) (contract.Verifier,error)`. Verify executes outside Unit and returns actual independently established observations under the pinned accepted profile; `_execution.verification.record` rechecks attempt/task/version before changing task state. A forged worker-provided VerificationResult is never accepted through public report. Concrete context/adapter/verification payload schemas are included in relevant prompts.

Administrative effects that have no task use their command/operation ID as an accountable admission root; no fictional worker/task or fabricated task foreign key is required. Accounting skips absent scope dimensions but always reserves installation and present organization ancestors/project limits. Task effects additionally share root_task_id. A profile without enforceable charge bounds cannot claim a hard cap.

Typed handler bindings return `contract.Outcome[O]` so accepted results and page cursors survive typed registration. The frozen Bind signature is `Bind[I, O any](contract.Descriptor, func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. Errors carry Fault and roll back, while accepted/completed status and cursor come from Outcome.

Assembly order: application.NewPorts() returns an unbound *PortRouter; For(owner string) returns an owner-bound contract.Ports without domain calls; construct identity and all other modules with those ports; registry.New(modules); application.New(db, registry, identityAuthenticator, clock, ids); router.Bind(app) exactly once; start serving only after Bind. PortRouter exposes `For(string) contract.Ports` and `Bind(*Application) error`, rejects pre-bind invocation, and never allows a domain to change its bound caller identity. Registry also implements Module for its own capabilities methods. Constructor execution must not query peers or start goroutines.

All native BlobStore objects are encrypted at rest (including public-classification content), because Stage has no classification argument. Metadata publication sets encrypted=true; classification separately governs disclosure. Controller records the raw adapter observation and cost disposition durably first, then publishes StagedOutput bytes outside Unit, then commits artifact metadata and normalized owner callbacks through an outbox consumer. Publication failure is a visible artifact obligation and blocks task/job acceptance; it does not erase a confirmed provider observation or authorize resending. The adapter cannot mint artifact IDs.

Entrypoint assembly owns platform.Acquire -> storage.Open -> Migrate -> Database.StartGeneration, exactly once before controller/server admission. Pass the held contract.Ownership into controller.New; controller never acquires a second lock or advances generation again. Ownership.Lost closes when ownership is lost/released; stop admission immediately. Generation is a persisted local-controller fence, not distributed locking. The installation lock is retained until controller shutdown and DB close.

Remote TLS additionally validates the certificate chain and maps the SHA-256 certificate SPKI fingerprint through application.AuthenticateCertificate(ctx,Digest), which delegates to identity Authenticator.AuthenticateCertificate on a read snapshot. Only a verified TLS peer can enter that API; operation input cannot supply the fingerprint. Store certificate fingerprints as identity-owned authentication metadata on an explicitly provisioned credential reference. If a bearer credential is also supplied, its principal must match the verified certificate principal. No self-asserted certificate name, profile name or fingerprint header grants authority.

Every async operation declares completion_schema separately from its immediate Job response. job.get returns that schema as Job.result only when established; pending jobs omit result. Local IO mutations that may be recovered asynchronously accept either their completed resource output or `{job: Job}` in the descriptor output schema. Bootstrap remains synchronous under its exclusive one-time lock. No unspecified job kind may execute: _execution.job.create requires a registered completion_schema or a specifically registered private local-intent recovery contract.

Evidence retains the complete original result envelope for command replay, including fault message/details/retryability and cursor; projections of status/data/error_code must agree with Command.result. `_evidence.command.finish` takes that exact result. A replay cannot reconstruct a different error or lose an accepted job reference. ScopeRequired lists installation_id where input scope is required; resource-specific organization/project/worker conditions are enforced by the owned operation schemas and current referenced-resource validation, never inferred from a profile name.

Descriptor.Callers carries the exact catalog internal caller allowlist into runtime registration; application enforces this metadata rather than inventing it from operation names. Internal metadata remains available to trusted assembly/registry while public capability output contains public operations only. An empty allowlist never authorizes an internal call.

## Owned product requirements

### R2.1-002 (source section 2.1; primary owner configuration)

One installation belongs to one operator or team and has one database, credential custody boundary, controller owner, and administrative trust root. It may contain multiple organizations. An organization is a grouping of teams, projects, workers, and configuration; it is not a hosted tenant.

### R2.1-003 (source section 2.1; primary owner configuration)

Organization and project scopes still restrict ordinary principals and workers. Cross-organization references require an explicit binding, and secrets are never globally available by default. These checks protect against accidental or unauthorized application access. They do not promise isolation from the installation administrator, database owner, or another process with unrestricted access to the same operating-system account.

### R2.1-004 (source section 2.1; primary owner configuration)

Organizations form an acyclic parent-child tree rooted in the personal organization. Bootstrap creates that root and its personal-chief identity; paid execution remains unavailable until the operator configures a provider and limits. Creating another organization creates its chief in the same configuration plan. Each active organization has exactly one designated chief, whose replacement preserves the organization's identity, memory, obligations, and history. Workers have one home organization; cross-organization assignments require explicit bindings. Creating an ordinary worker does not create an organization.

### R2.1-005 (source section 2.1; primary owner configuration)

Parent organizations impose permission ceilings and aggregate budget limits on descendants. Child policy can narrow those limits, never expand them. Parent chiefs receive authorized reports from children, not automatic access to every descendant's private memory, credentials, or project data. Moving an organization or worker is an explicit configuration plan that rechecks inherited limits and memory bindings; it cannot silently transfer old private memories or widen the authority of active work.

### R2.1-006 (source section 2.1; primary owner configuration)

There is no tenant routing, tenant signup, tenant billing, or hosted multitenant control plane in v1. Separate installations are the boundary for mutually untrusted operators. Installation IDs prevent accidental mixing of exports, credentials, and checkpoints; they are not tenant IDs in another form.

### R5-002 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Bootstrap establishes a local owner under explicit OS-level installation access. `installation.init` is available through both interfaces before normal authentication exists, but only in a one-time local bootstrap mode. `zatiti init` and `zatiti mcp serve --bootstrap` use the same initializer. Bootstrap checks the destination is uninitialized, acquires exclusive ownership, creates owner credentials in the selected secure store, and returns metadata only. It refuses reinitialization; it never exports an owner token into model context. Bootstrap mode ends after successful initialization and cannot be used as an alternate administration session.

### R5-003 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Normal CLI and MCP sessions select an explicitly provisioned local credential profile. The controller authenticates its credential and resolves a principal; a profile name, tool argument, MCP client name, socket access, or OS username alone does not establish application authority. MCP tool arguments cannot select a more privileged profile. Subprocesses do not receive the owner's credential environment by default. Same-user processes with access to the secure store remain within the OS trust boundary described in section 2.

### R5-004 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

An owner can delegate administration of named organizations, projects, workers, skills, and connections to a client-agent principal. This permits an agent to create and activate ordinary configuration within that existing envelope without a human confirming every edit. Requests outside the envelope produce a precise review or denial. Authority is evaluated using current grants and policy, never the proposed replacement policy.

### R5-005 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Permissions intersect principal scope, project/organization binding, worker/task scope where applicable, policy, active restrictions, resource availability, and required review. Delegation only narrows tool access, destinations, deadlines, and shared budgets. Explicit denials win. Unknown required conditions refuse admission. Worker self-modification and imported skill text cannot install grants.

### R5-006 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Policy supports standing authorized classes and exact-review classes. Default external publication, outbound messages, merges, deployment, credential-account substitution, and permission expansion require an eligible owner's decision unless the owner has explicitly established a narrower standing policy for that class. New policy is applied under old authority. Enabling automation, including an earned-autonomy promotion rule, is an explicit administrative act, not a competence score or model assertion.

### R5-007 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Workers and chiefs start with minimum permissions. The product supports increasing autonomy up to the operator's explicitly authorized ceilings. Chiefs propose promotions using recorded outcomes; deterministic rules evaluate independently established evidence against operator-approved requirements before activating a narrowly scoped grant. Without an applicable promotion rule, expansion requires the eligible owner's decision. No worker can approve its own evidence, rewrite its qualification criteria, or enlarge the ceiling that permits promotion.

### R5-008 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Qualifications bind capability, destination/scope, worker identity, relevant model/tool/skill versions, evidence window, and the promotion-rule version. Success in one capability does not grant unrelated powers. Relevant configuration changes trigger requalification; specified failures or incidents automatically restrict or demote the affected grant before further admission. Promotion and demotion produce durable events and user-visible explanations. Mandatory human-review classes remain mandatory unless the owner explicitly changes their governing policy under existing authority.

### R5-009 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Reviews declare whether a human is required. The same `review.decide` operation exists in CLI and MCP; both enforce principal kind, eligibility, current version, action digest, expiry, and optional separation of proposer and reviewer. An agent credential cannot satisfy a human-required review, even if it sends `approved_by_human: true` or runs the CLI instead. A human session can use either transport. V1 does not claim a model invocation through a human-authorized process proves physical human presence; installation owners are responsible for credential delegation.

### R5-010 (source section 5; primary owner identity)

Pause, revoke, and cancel commit restrictive state immediately under authorized access, without a model call, configuration compilation, or spend reservation. Resume and expansion use normal authorization. A pause prevents future admissions; it cannot retract a request already transmitted or terminate an uncooperative external process by assertion.

### R7.1-002 (source section 7.1; primary owner skills)

A skill package contains instructions, optional bounded supporting files, input/output schemas, declared tool/data requirements, and optional evaluation fixtures. Support `SKILL.md` packages using the published Agent Skills format through a validating import adapter; store executable meaning in Zatiti's versioned metadata rather than inventing authority from frontmatter. Skills are reusable across organizations only through explicit bindings.

### R7.1-003 (source section 7.1; primary owner skills)

Import creates an immutable draft version with content hashes, source and license provenance, dependencies, and diagnostics. Reject path traversal, symlink escapes, device files, duplicate/case-colliding paths, oversized extraction, and dependency cycles before publication. Imported scripts do not execute during discovery, import, or archive extraction. Imported text and tool output remain untrusted data.

### R7.1-004 (source section 7.1; primary owner skills)

Evaluation can run against sealed fixture inputs before a worker activates. Pin the candidate, evaluator, inputs, model/profile, limits, and expected observations. Agent-generated tests are development evidence; they do not replace an independently accepted completion contract. A changed skill, evaluator, dependency, or model invalidates only the qualifications that depended on it. Evaluation does not automatically expand authority.

### R15-002 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

Serenity supplies accumulated knowledge; Zatiti owns execution state, authorization, acceptance, budgets, and recovery obligations. Use its public interfaces through a pinned adapter, without importing its internal packages or creating a competing canonical memory writer. The integration must qualify the pinned implementation rather than treating upstream documentation as proof of supported behavior.

### R15-003 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

Each worker has an individual brain, each organization has a shared brain, and the installation has a separate brain for deliberately shared cross-organizational knowledge. The personal chief's worker memory, the root organization's shared memory, and installation-wide memory remain distinct scopes even when one chief curates them. Separate brains are logical access boundaries enforced by Zatiti's bindings; they do not isolate data from the installation administrator or unrestricted same-user filesystem access.

### R15-004 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

Memory bindings explicitly name read, write, curate/promote, and retract permissions. Zatiti resolves the caller's current worker, task, project, organization ancestry, and grants before selecting brains to query. Filter before retrieval or model composition, not after unauthorized data has already reached a model. An organization brain contains only knowledge suitable for its authorized readers; restricted project information remains in a narrower bound brain or governed artifact. Parentage alone never grants read access to a child's private knowledge.

### R15-005 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

Organization chiefs automatically curate shared memory within their standing authority: reconcile evidence, retain useful lessons, identify contradictions, and promote suitable knowledge from permitted worker or child-organization sources. The personal chief curates installation-wide memory. Automatic curation is scoped work with budgets and evidence, not permission to read everything. Promotion is a new destination claim linked to source brain, claim/version, supporting artifact references, curator identity, and any redaction. It requires both source disclosure authority and destination write authority. Shared-memory writes that exceed that envelope wait for the appropriate decision.

### R15-006 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

Corrections and retractions propagate through recorded promotion lineage as durable reconciliation obligations. A promoted statement is not independent corroboration of its own source. Revocation blocks subsequent retrieval immediately; it cannot erase already disclosed context. Forget/retract operations distinguish removal from active recall from historical erasure, including copies in Git history, backups, and prior run artifacts. The UI must state that distinction when relevant.

### R15-007 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

The adapter provides memory recall, remember, inspect, promotion, and retraction operations through the shared registry and exposes their supported prerequisites and outcomes equally through CLI and MCP. Desktop memory controls and conversational requests call those same operations. Recalled results retain scope, source references, confidence, relevant versions, and freshness; each run stores the actual selected context as an artifact. Reads across brains are not presumed to be one atomic snapshot. A task requiring unavailable freshness waits or reports a prerequisite failure rather than silently treating stale context as current.

### R15-008 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

Serenity's exported Go read facade may serve compatible reads. Canonical writes go to exactly one writer owner per brain through the supported protocol. Its Recall path may invoke models and record spend: "read" does not imply no disclosure or no charge. Composition, embedding, extraction, and curation must obey Zatiti's provider disclosure rules and reservations; until the adapter can enforce a required bound, that execution mode is unavailable or explicitly advisory where policy permits. Serenity's remembered judgments and plan checks inform work but cannot override Zatiti policy or constitute task acceptance on their own.

### R15-009 (source section 15; primary owner memory)

Zatiti's SQLite transaction cannot atomically commit a Serenity write. Persist a submission intent and adapter command identity before dispatch, record the actual disposition afterward, and reconcile a lost acknowledgment without blindly repeating the write. Backup manifests pin the required brain revisions and key-recovery prerequisites alongside Zatiti state. Restore starts paused and reconciles pending memory writes and promotions before resuming curation. Availability failures remain visible; no failed memory operation is presented as remembered knowledge.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"}},"required":["scope","id"]}
```
Output data schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"resource":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Policy"}},"required":["resource"]}
```

### `policy.list` v1 — policy / public / query / local

CLI `zatiti policy list`; MCP `zatiti_policy_list`. Submission key: not required at this internal/query/bootstrap boundary.

Read an authorized consistent snapshot. Apply scope and filter before pagination. Cursor binds principal and query. Filters are structured exact-match fields (AND semantics); unsupported fields for this resource refuse invalid_input. Never interpolate filter strings as SQL.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"cursor":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"limit":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":200},"filter":{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"state":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"key":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192},"parent_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"worker_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"task_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"organization_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"descendants":{"type":"boolean"},"needs_you":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":[]}},"required":["scope"]}
```
Output data schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"items":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Policy"},"maxItems":500}},"required":["items"]}
```

### `policy.update` v1 — policy / public / mutation / local

CLI `zatiti policy update`; MCP `zatiti_policy_update`. Submission key: required.

Stage a typed update in configuration; return draft and resource identity. Never directly activate a definition. Explicit archive checks retained work and obligations; no omission deletion.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"expected_version":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":9223372036854775807},"definition":{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"rules":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Rule"},"maxItems":4096},"extensions":{"type":"object","description":"Inert JSON data bounded by the enclosing size limit; never executable authority."}},"required":["scope","rules"]},"draft_id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"}},"required":["scope","id","expected_version","definition"]}
```
Output data schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"draft":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Draft"},"resource":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Policy"}},"required":["draft","resource"]}
```

### Local schema definitions

The schemas above resolve exclusively against this embedded `$defs` object. Input objects reject additional properties except explicitly open schema/data fields. Field semantics are completed by the owned requirements and operation descriptions. Output `resource`, `items`, `draft`, `job`, etc. are literal keys. Pagination cursor lives in the common envelope.

## Named acceptance cases

Tests are implementation deliverables, not claims of already executed qualification. Retain expected/observed results, exact source/config/tool versions and failure evidence.

### Z01.revoked_principal — Z01

Setup: A client principal has an authenticated session and an authorized scoped mutation.

Action: Revoke its credential or grant, then repeat the mutation using the existing session.

Expected:

- Current authorization denies the mutation.
- Revocation is durable and survives controller restart.

### Z01.cross_scope_reference — Z01

Setup: Two organizations contain separate projects, workers and connections with no cross-scope binding.

Action: Use an otherwise authorized principal to reference the other organization or project in a draft and task.

Expected:

- The unauthorized reference is rejected.
- No activation, task admission or secret lookup occurs until an explicit valid binding exists.

### Z04.old_authority — Z04

Setup: A principal may edit a draft but cannot expand its own effective grants.

Action: Submit a plan containing a policy or grant that would authorize its own application.

Expected:

- Apply evaluates existing authority and rejects or requests an eligible exact decision.
- Proposed policy and imported instructions cannot authorize their own activation.

### Z05.malicious_instructions — Z05

Setup: A skill includes instructions to read secrets, self-grant permissions and ignore reviews.

Action: Import, bind and execute the skill in a constrained task.

Expected:

- Instructions remain untrusted input and install no grants.
- Tool, data and effect access remains limited to the pinned authorized binding closure.

### Z05.changed_tool_schema — Z05

Setup: An active worker binding pins a tool identity/version/schema.

Action: Change the provider-discovered schema or executable binding while retaining the old activation plan.

Expected:

- Changed executable meaning cannot silently enter the active tool closure.
- Revalidation and authorized activation are required; unsupported contracts return capability or prerequisite faults.

### Z05.empty_bindings — Z05

Setup: A worker has no explicit tools or cross-scope bindings.

Action: Ask it to use a known installation connection and a tool visible in discovery.

Expected:

- The worker receives no implicit global tool or credential access.
- Missing or ambiguous scope produces a named refusal rather than selecting a global organization.

### Z05.agent_self_grant — Z05

Setup: A client agent can create ordinary scoped definitions under a fixed delegation envelope.

Action: Attempt to enlarge its scope, authorize worker self-modification or establish an autonomy rule above the envelope.

Expected:

- No authority expands without an eligible act under existing policy.
- The exact denial or review requirement identifies the missing authority.

### Z06.admission_claim_revoke — Z06

Setup: A controlled adapter exposes barriers before admission, before claim and before invocation.

Action: Race revocation or pause against admission and claim in each ordering.

Expected:

- Revocation committed before claim prevents invocation; physical call count is zero.
- Admission reserves and writes intent/evidence atomically; claimed dispatch follows the specified irreversible boundary.
- Revocation after claim is recorded honestly and does not claim to retract transmitted bytes.

### Z07.reviewer_eligibility — Z07

Setup: Reviews include current version, expiry, proposer-separation and reviewer delegation restrictions.

Action: Decide using revoked or ineligible delegated credentials, an expired review, a stale version or the prohibited proposer.

Expected:

- Each ineligible decision is refused using current identity and policy.
- A permitted delegation is scoped and cannot bypass human-required or proposer-separation rules.

### Z12.delegation_narrows — Z12

Setup: A root task has finite scope, allowed tools/destinations, project data, deadline and shared budget.

Action: Independently delegate children expanding scope, tool access, data access, deadline or spending authority.

Expected:

- Each expansion is refused or reduced only through an explicit valid narrowing contract.
- Delegation cannot grant authority absent from its parent or inherited organization policy.

### Z17.hierarchy_cycles — Z17

Setup: Organizations form a valid root/child/grandchild tree.

Action: Attempt to parent the root under a descendant or create any cycle.

Expected:

- Planning or activation rejects cycles.
- The original hierarchy and inherited limits remain unchanged.

### Z17.inherited_denial — Z17

Setup: A parent explicitly denies an action that a child policy attempts to allow.

Action: Plan the child policy and attempt the action in the descendant scope.

Expected:

- The inherited denial wins and child policy cannot enlarge the parent ceiling.
- Parent-chief report access does not imply unrestricted access to descendant credentials, data or private memory.

### Z17.ancestor_budget_exhaustion — Z17

Setup: A child has local funds but an applicable ancestor budget is exhausted.

Action: Admit a paid child task or model call.

Expected:

- Admission is refused without provider dispatch.
- Every descendant reserves against applicable ancestor budgets and cannot bypass an exhausted aggregate limit.

### Z17.scoped_reparenting — Z17

Setup: A worker or organization with active work and private memory is moved between scopes with different ceilings.

Action: Apply the move through a configuration plan.

Expected:

- Inherited authority, budgets and memory bindings are rechecked.
- Existing private memories are not silently transferred and active work does not acquire broader authority.

### Z18.unauthorized_brain_not_queried — Z18

Setup: Instrumented brains include permitted worker/org brains and an unbound private descendant brain.

Action: Recall as a caller lacking the private brain binding.

Expected:

- The unauthorized brain receives zero read/model requests.
- Filtering occurs before retrieval and model composition; hierarchy alone supplies no private-memory access.

### Z18.restricted_project_memory — Z18

Setup: A worker can read one restricted project brain but an organization-wide audience cannot.

Action: Curate organization memory and recall as an ordinary organization member.

Expected:

- Restricted project content is excluded from the broadly shared brain and model context.
- Promotion cannot disclose it without current source-disclosure and destination-write authority.

### Z18.revoked_memory_binding — Z18

Setup: A worker previously recalled a brain and then loses its binding.

Action: Recall again and inspect prior run artifacts.

Expected:

- Subsequent brain retrieval is denied immediately under current authority.
- The system does not claim revocation erases previously disclosed context; historical artifacts remain governed by their own retention/access rules.

### Z19.self_promotion — Z19

Setup: A worker has minimum permissions and may propose a capability promotion.

Action: Have it approve its own evidence, edit its qualification criteria or raise the governing ceiling.

Expected:

- The worker cannot authorize any of those expansions.
- Without an applicable owner-approved rule, promotion waits for an eligible owner decision.

### Z19.unsupported_evidence — Z19

Setup: An owner-approved promotion rule requires independently established results in a specified evidence window.

Action: Submit model assertions, unverified worker tests, stale evidence or provenance-free memory claims as proof.

Expected:

- Insufficient evidence is rejected with an inspectable explanation.
- No grant activates solely from competence narration or a remembered judgment.

### Z19.capability_promotion — Z19

Setup: A rule permits one exact capability/destination for one worker under specified model/tool/skill versions.

Action: Supply qualifying evidence and evaluate the rule.

Expected:

- Only the exact permitted capability/scope activates within the prior ceiling.
- Unrelated powers remain unavailable; durable events identify the evidence and rule version responsible.

### Z19.version_requalification — Z19

Setup: A worker has qualifications depending on recorded model, tool, skill and evaluator versions.

Action: Change one relevant version, and separately change an unrelated dependency.

Expected:

- Affected qualifications require requalification before qualifying further admission.
- Only qualifications that depended on the changed configuration are invalidated; unsupported prior evidence is not reused silently.

### Z19.immediate_demotion — Z19

Setup: An active earned grant has an owner-approved incident/failure demotion rule.

Action: Record a qualifying incident concurrently with a new effect admission.

Expected:

- Restriction or demotion commits before any subsequently authorized admission can use the old grant.
- The user can inspect durable reasons and events; no model call or new spending is required to apply restriction.

### Z19.human_review_preserved — Z19

Setup: A worker earns a related capability but the governing policy still requires a human for a specific action class.

Action: Attempt that class under the new qualification.

Expected:

- The human-required decision remains mandatory.
- Only an explicitly authorized owner policy change under existing authority can change the mandatory class.

### Z20.responsibility_pause — Z20

Setup: Two responsibilities have active/queued work and only one is selected for pause.

Action: Pause that responsibility and race its next wake.

Expected:

- Restrictive state commits immediately and prevents new admission for that responsibility.
- Unrelated work is not cancelled; already transmitted effects and unresolved outcomes remain visible.

### Z21.groups_and_quiet_coordination — Z21

Setup: Workers from separate organizations share a group conversation and chiefs exchange routine reports.

Action: Create/join the group, share attachments, deliver routine internal coordination and inspect notifications.

Expected:

- Group membership changes neither worker home organization nor memory/tool authority; attachment sharing remains a governed disclosure.
- Routine coordination does not continually reorder chats, mark them unread or notify the human.
- Reports upward obey explicit reporting/data bindings.

### Z21.capability_and_pause_cards — Z21

Setup: A worker has a proposed promotion and active work with a possibly transmitted effect.

Action: Inspect promotion details, pause or stop the relevant work and observe offline/online acknowledgement.

Expected:

- Autonomy is shown as exact capabilities and authority changes with evidence and rule/decision status, not a universal trust score.
- Pause/stop reports controller acknowledgement and unresolved external effects honestly; responsibility creation does not imply expanded authority.

### JOURNEY.desktop_daily_work — JOURNEY

Setup: Launch the actual packaged desktop on a supported platform with a personal-chief conversation.

Action: Create marketing/engineering organizations and ordinary workers, assign a bounded task and ongoing responsibility, inspect result and memory, then handle an exact pending decision.

Expected:

- The visible hierarchy and work states match queried controller state rather than model narration.
- Memory scope/lineage and earned autonomy meet their own Z18/Z19 gates.
- Capture executed UI observations for setup and daily results/decisions; mocked view models alone are insufficient.

## Delivery

Implement production behavior and meaningful local tests within scope. Report files changed, commands actually run, observed results, unresolved dependency qualifications and contract defects. A missing dependency may use an exact local fake for development; production must return a named prerequisite/unsupported error instead of fake success. Integration owns shared dependency changes, real assembly, cross-package proving and landing. Do not advertise release or client/platform support from compilation alone.
