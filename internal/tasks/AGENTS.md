# Implementation assignment: `internal/tasks`

Generated specification revision 4; source digest `c01f3bc31dc5dd33292b6ffcfc024b981b829783dd430ec00dff3efde7ab9f12`. This file is committed implementation context. Do not independently edit it. Everything required from the product specification and adjacent interfaces is embedded below; no RFC copy is required.

## Mission and scope

Own durable outcomes, immutable accepted contracts, dependency graph and narrowing delegation.

Write scope: **`internal/tasks/` only**, excluding this generated AGENTS.md. Go package name: `tasks`. Ownership kind: domain; integration wave: 2.

Allowed production imports from this repository: `github.com/zatiti/zatiti/internal/contract`. Tests may use interfaces/fakes defined locally and, once available, storage-backed temporary fixtures; integration owns cross-package tests. No sibling raw SQL. No root dependency edits except the integration exception stated in its own brief.

## Implementation decisions and acceptance focus

Own tasks_tasks/dependencies/acceptance/history. States: draft→ready→running→verifying→succeeded or failed; running/ready/verifying may wait with explicit reason and resume to prior admissible state; authorized cancel records intent first, terminal cancelled after stop/fencing disposition. Retry from failed/cancelled creates a new run/attempt under same accepted contract after recovery prerequisites. A worker cannot transition directly to succeeded. Parent success checks explicit required child acceptance, not merely child exit. Prevent dependency cycles. Seal verifier code/version, inputs and expected observations before execution; pending input edits require version and cannot replace accepted verifier in flight. Independent verification runs trusted pinned code through an explicitly qualified verifier runner with artifacts isolated from worker rewriting. V1 built-ins: artifact presence/digest/schema and repository patch check using pinned controlled verification command/profile; arbitrary worker-supplied verifier code is never executed as acceptance authority. Manual acceptance requires eligible configured principal and distinct manual flag. Direct user and chief assignment update same versioned task. Delegation intersects tools/destinations/project data/deadline and shares root budgets; enforce finite depth/count/concurrency/planner/model/time limits. Revision 3: task.start transitions an eligible draft/ready task to ready and enqueues its run in the same transaction, distinct from task.create (draft only) and task.assign (worker/version only, unchanged). _tasks.evidence.record is the sole path that binds trusted verifier evidence to a pinned acceptance digest and named output bindings before any task state depends on it. _tasks.dependencies.wake bounded-scans dependents of a just-completed task and revalidates their eligibility; it never reports success for a dependent whose required child failed.

Local proving focus: Exit zero missing artifact, tampered verifier, worker assertion, failed-child acceptance, manual label, stale concurrent assignment, dependency cycle, cancellation with unknown effect, narrowed delegation.

## Incoming and outgoing boundaries

Incoming callers: controller, effects, execution, installation, memory, messaging, policy, reviews, scheduling, application (authenticated public operations).

Outgoing owner calls: `_configuration.snapshot`, `_policy.check`, `_policy.invalidate`, `_reviews.check`, `_accounting.reserve`, `_accounting.inspect`, `_artifacts.metadata`, `_execution.enqueue`. Each exact input/output schema appears below. Calls retain current Unit/authority; owner allowlists are mandatory.

Expose `New(contract.Dependencies) (*Service,error)`; `*Service` implements `contract.Module` with Name `tasks`, owner-prefixed migrations, all owned descriptors, and strict dispatch. No calls/goroutines during construction. Implement optional authentication/LocalIO interfaces where specified in the common contract. Tables are private under `tasks_`; external callers rely only on methods and schemas.

### Imported package APIs and behavior

These briefs are embedded so you need not read a sibling prompt to discover its incoming API. Implement only your own package.

## Shared foundation contract

# Frozen implementation contract, revision 4

These decisions complete the product specification and bind every scope. Report contradictions with an affected-dependency list and proposed coordinated revision; do not change another owner's interface locally.

Revision 3 changes, each a coordinated revision that code written against revision 2 must follow. Every new field named below is additive and optional on an existing type: no existing required field changed type, name or was removed, so old persisted rows validate unchanged and remain inspectable with the new field simply absent. New tables (`WorkerTurn`, proposal records) and new operations have no prior callers to break.

- **Durable worker turn.** Execution owns a persisted `WorkerTurn` (see the embedded `WorkerTurn`/`TurnSource` schemas in `internal/execution`'s generated prompt) keyed by unique `(installation_id, source_kind, source_id, source_version, recipient_worker_id)`; re-admission through `_execution.turn.admit` returns the same turn. A pending inbox message and its turn admission/processed marker (`_messaging.processed`) commit in one shared transaction. A message arriving during an active turn is admitted as a safe-boundary injection durably linked to that turn, never silently dropped or processed twice. One active decision stream exists per worker/task lane; different eligible workers may run concurrently within aggregate limits. Each model step/proposal is stored separately as a `ProposalRecord` keyed by unique `(turn_id, step_index, proposal_id)`; the same key with different bytes is `submission_conflict`.
- **Worker turn pipeline operations.** `_execution.work.pending`/`.claim`, `_execution.context.prepare`/`.commit`, `_execution.proposal.prepare`/`.record`, `_execution.report`, `_execution.verification.pending`/`.claim`, `_tasks.evidence.record`, `_tasks.dependencies.wake`, `_messaging.ready`/`.processed` are new internal operations driving the durable worker loop end to end (admit → claim work → prepare/commit context → dispatch a model or tool effect → record the proposal → report → independently verify). Public `task.start` transitions an eligible draft/ready task to ready and enqueues its run in the same transaction; `task.create`/`task.assign` are unchanged. Exact schemas, callers and behavior are embedded in the generated prompts of `internal/execution`, `internal/tasks` and `internal/messaging`.
- **Worker operation executor.** A narrow `contract.WorkerOperator` capability (declared below) lets a worker-authored local proposal invoke an ordinary public operation under the worker's own authenticated actor, scope-intersected with the task/source authorization envelope. It resolves the actor from the persisted turn/worker mapping; `WorkerID` is an asserted match against that turn, never a way to select any principal. Local model-visible operations are an explicit allowlist (authorized configuration authoring/inspection, task/delegation/responsibility actions, approved memory/messaging operations, output publication); grant/policy changes, secrets, internal bookkeeping and human review never become available merely because they exist in the public catalog. The controller's administrative identity authorizes scheduling/bookkeeping only, never a model proposal. **Public/internal caller fix:** `task.assign` is a public operation and carries no caller allowlist (the registry rejects a public descriptor with callers — confirmed 2026-09-18 descriptor-drift finding in docs/roadmap.md); a chief-driven assignment is an ordinary authenticated `task.assign` call made through this executor under the requesting worker's own actor, not a domain-internal caller path.
- **Effects callback routing.** `Operation` gains optional `attempts` (`{attempt_id, generation}` pairs, additive alongside the unchanged `attempt_ids`) and optional `callback_route`; `Dispatch` gains the matching optional `callback_route`. `_effects.prepare` accepts an optional `callback_route` (`CallbackRoute`: `worker_turn`/`job`/`memory`/`skill`/`connection` plus the relevant turn/step/job id) persisted alongside the action and returned at claim. The controller resolves callback routing from this persisted route; it never infers routing by inserting an undeclared `attempt_id` into strict adapter parameters (fixes audit finding G05). `_effects.record` gains an optional `current_generation` for the successor-generation rule: a stray attempt is `not_sent` if never actually claimed under its recorded generation, `outcome_unknown` if claimed but unconfirmed — never silently dropped.
- **Effects reconciliation reaches `Adapter.Reconcile`.** New `_effects.reconciliation.prepare`/`.record` create a separately admitted, separately authorized and accounted bounded reconciliation read distinct from the original write, merging the qualified observation into the original operation's uncertainty without overwriting history or replaying the original action (fixes audit finding G13).
- **Job registry linkage.** `_execution.job.create` gains an optional `operation_id`, linking a network-backed job to its originating effects `Operation` at creation so reconciliation resolves it without scanning another owner's table; a job without `operation_id` is an ordinary local runner. New `_skills.evaluation.record` and `_configuration.export.prepare`/`.record` route skill evaluation and configuration export/import through this durable job ledger instead of handler-local ID minting with no owner-backed lookup (fixes audit findings G11, G12).
- **Registry lookup and schema normalization (already implemented; confirmed for revision 3).** `Lookup(id, 0)` resolves the highest registered version for that operation id. The registry accepts either a bare `$defs`-relative schema or a fully self-contained document at registration, and `Lookup` always returns a self-contained document pruned to reachable `$defs`. These two rules were implemented and tested against application's assumptions before this revision; this entry is their authored record (docs/roadmap.md, 2026-09-18).
- **CLI root tokens (clarification, no schema change).** `Descriptor.CLI` is the subcommand path only and excludes the binary name; `cmd/zatiti` prepends `zatiti` once at command-tree assembly. Generated `AGENTS.md` prose shows the full invocation (for example "CLI `zatiti artifact export`") for readability — that rendering convenience is not part of the wire contract, and an implementer must not treat the printed binary name as part of `Descriptor.CLI` (this ambiguity produced a wrong descriptor token shape in 11 modules; docs/roadmap.md, 2026-09-18).
- **Service-principal bootstrap.** `_identity.bootstrap` gains optional `service_credential_id`/`service_store_ref` so the bootstrap-created controller service principal can receive a credential in the same transaction, letting an out-of-process controller authenticate; omitted fields leave the service principal credential-less for the in-process explicit-`Actor` seam, unchanged from revision 2.
- **Review eligibility (ruling, confirmed for revision 3).** The eligible reviewer of an exact review-class request is the human principal whose current authority admitted that request; services, workers and agents are never eligible, and proposer separation stays mandatory for them. This settles "an eligible owner's decision" left undefined in revision 2's policy/reviews briefs (docs/roadmap.md, 2026-09-18 evening REVISION-3 RULING).
- **Internal authority checks (ruling, confirmed for revision 3).** `_identity.authority`, like every internal operation, is gated by its caller allowlist and by the calling actor being a registered, unrevoked principal in the transaction's installation — never by requiring the calling actor to independently hold the capability named in its own request. A standing grant of `_identity.authority` to work around a circular subject-capability check is unnecessary and must not be relied upon (docs/roadmap.md, 2026-09-19 REVISION-3 RULING). Whether an actor may read another principal's authority is an explicit code-level decision this ruling does not settle; downstream implementers must document it in place rather than infer it.
- **Artifact locator staging (confirmed unchanged).** `PhysicalCallEvidence.request_context` and `ModelOutput.request_context` remain the revision-2 `ArtifactLocator` retype; revision 3 makes no further change here and extends the same staged/artifact pattern to `_execution.context.commit`'s `staged_context`.
- **Responses `prepare_session`/`model_step` split.** See "OpenAI Responses session preparation" below.
- **Small query/result additions.** `conversation.get`/`.list` return the calling principal's optional `caller_unread_count`/`caller_last_read_marker`; new public `conversation.message.list` reads authorized message history for one conversation. New public `memory.list` lists authorized scoped claim refs (source/freshness/lineage/supported actions) without performing paid retrieval. `Artifact` gains optional `source_operation_id`/`purpose` (provenance). `Status` gains optional `runtime_ready`. `Responsibility` gains optional `last_cycle_id`, and `_scheduling.cycle.record` gains a required `cycle_id` replay/conflict fence plus optional `turn_id` linkage. New public `installation.verifier.list` enumerates installed trusted verifier profiles (secret-free) so a task's acceptance contract can name one. `event.list`'s drained-cursor/filter/scope/principal/retention behavior is unchanged; this is its explicit revision-3 confirmation, not a schema change. Public task/turn status projection and installed-capability desktop surfacing are explicitly deferred to `internal/evidence` (P34) and `apps/desktop` (P42) rather than invented here.
- **Local decision tools pinned separately from provider tools.** `ReplyProposal`, `ClarifyProposal`, `ReportOutputsProposal` and `CycleDecisionProposal` (schemas below) are the sealed names/inputs for the context builder's non-provider decision tools (`reply`, `clarify`, `report_outputs`, `cycle_decision`). They are execution-local proposals evaluated by the worker operation executor, never routed through a `connections.Tool`/adapter and never given a provider operation mapping; a final text answer alone may complete a chat turn but never implicitly fulfills a task's required outputs.
- Desktop client (ADR 002): the desktop is a Flutter application at `apps/desktop` that is a direct wire client of internal/server. The Go roots `internal/desktop` and `cmd/zatiti-desktop` are retired; no Go package may import or stand in for the desktop.
- Adapter request context: `PhysicalCallEvidence.request_context` and `ModelOutput.request_context` are an `ArtifactLocator`, not a bare `ArtifactRef`. Adapters return the staged variant; the controller publishes it and substitutes the artifact variant in normalized evidence.
- **MCP client connection adapter (coordinated revision 2026-09-24, dec-1256).** New ownership root `internal/adapters/mcpclient` (adapter name `mcp`, provider `mcp`), the fifth adapter beside responses/github/httpread/serenity, with frozen `MCPClientProfile`/`MCPClientParameters`/`MCPClientEvidence` schemas in `docs/implementation/adapter-schemas.json`; new public `connection.discover` and `connection.tools` and internal `_connections.discovery.record` on `internal/connections`, plus the `MCPDiscoveredTool` DTO. Additive: no existing type, operation or table changes. Section below.
- Installation database seam: `contract.DatabaseBackup` is a one-method capability that entrypoint assembly supplies only to internal/installation through `installation.WithDatabaseBackup`. `contract.Dependencies` is unchanged and no domain gains general database access.

## Build and dependency decisions

Module `github.com/zatiti/zatiti`; language `go 1.26.0`; initial toolchain `go1.26.2`. Integration owns go.mod/go.sum. The Flutter desktop pins its own Flutter/Dart SDK and plugins in `apps/desktop/pubspec.lock`; integration records those pins and licenses in the same lock report and the Go module never depends on them. Domains import standard library and internal/contract, not sibling domains. Application composes owner methods through a checked in-process dispatcher: ordinary Go calls, not another server or scheduler.

Library families: Cobra CLI; official MCP Go SDK, handwritten adapter for MCP `2025-11-25`; Flutter (Dart) desktop application at `apps/desktop` with an operating-system secure-storage plugin, outside the Go module; modernc.org/sqlite. Mint is optional build-time tooling and cannot weaken contracts. Hosted provider v1: a specifically qualified OpenAI Responses endpoint/profile, with configured model and prices. Other compatible endpoints remain unavailable until qualified. GitHub uses documented REST over net/http, with mutation retries disabled. Serenity is a separate pinned service using public interfaces only. Integration must resolve exact dependency releases/commits, checksums, licenses and qualification commands in a lock report BEFORE dispatching dependent implementation. These are selected implementation families, not claims that upstream behavior has been qualified. No agent independently substitutes libraries, models, prices, accounts or Serenity APIs. Dependency resolution/qualification is an explicit foundation assignment.

## Shared Go declarations

The contract owner implements these exact declarations. Omitted function bodies are the implementation assignment, not production stubs. Public JSON uses snake_case. Schema-derived DTO names concatenate operation path segments in PascalCase plus Input/Output and live in the owning package. JSON integer => int64, UUID => contract.ID, timestamp => time.Time, optional scalar => pointer, array => slice, explicitly open JSON => json.RawMessage. Unknown fields are rejected.

The registry binds concrete input/output DTO types to descriptors and handlers using `Bind[I, O any](descriptor contract.Descriptor, fn func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. JSON decoding is strict and schema validation precedes execution. Internal cross-owner calls use the same schema-checked Invocation boundary to avoid sibling package imports. They retain the same Unit, actor, scope, generation and transaction; cannot mint authority; and are not exposed as public operations.

## Transaction and ownership rules

Each domain owns tables prefixed with its package name and `_`. Schema and migration bodies inside that namespace are package-private; no other package depends on their layout. Storage owns installation generation, migration metadata and `storage_events`. Evidence owns commands/receipts. Migration ordering is explicit in application assembly. All migrations run under exclusive installation ownership before serving. Cross-owner reads and changes use Ports.Call and the embedded internal schemas. Internal operations have a caller allowlist. The dispatcher detects recursive calls. Queries cannot invoke mutation descriptors. Public clients cannot supply Actor or Unit or invoke internal operations.

One controller, one ordered writer, WAL, foreign keys on every connection, synchronous FULL, busy timeout 5 seconds, consistent read snapshots. Database.Write performs ONE transaction callback attempt with no automatic callback retry. Busy exhaustion returns controller_unavailable/retryable. Unit is valid only inside its callback; no goroutines or retained handles. Unit.Emit appends state-correlated evidence to the storage outbox in the same transaction. Delivery is at least once and consumers deduplicate event IDs. No network/model calls, secret-store access, filesystem streaming or subprocess work inside a Unit. Stage bytes or local helper actions outside transactions, then publish metadata or reconciliation intent through owner methods.

Handler errors roll back the entire transaction. Persist a command refusal in a separate short transaction after rollback where necessary, retaining the original request identity. Query command IDs need not be durable. All mutations return durable command IDs; accepted responses must identify inspectable durable work. Output schemas describe Payload.Data, not the result envelope. Never leak SQL, tokens, provider raw responses or private paths through Fault.

Definition creates/updates/archive stage drafts, including schedules, responsibilities, policies and memory bindings. Only configuration.apply activates definitions. It validates owners' candidate slices, seals base revision/dependencies/requirements, and calls internal activate in the same transaction under old authority. Internal activate is admitted only from the compiler during exact plan application, not by a public flag. Public restrictive pause/revoke/cancel commits immediately without compilation or spending. Archive staging may immediately disable new admissions as an explicitly reported restrictive side effect; final removal waits for obligations.

## Effect and execution rules

Admit: current authorization, exact review/preconditions, all budget reservations, attempt/dispatch intent and evidence atomically. Claim: second transaction rechecks generation/restrictions/expiry and consumes the one-use claim. Invoke the adapter outside transactions. Record: third transaction stores observations, costs or retained uncertainty and events. Each physical call, including reconciliation and retries, has a distinct attempt. Reconciliation is an admitted bounded read and links to the original effect; it does not overwrite history. Internal jobs use explicitly provisioned scoped service identities plus current worker/task restrictions.

Once claimed, crash/timeout/cancel/lease expiry/operator acknowledgement/weak not-found cannot prove nonexecution. Preserve outcome_unknown and its reservation until authoritative evidence. Earlier unknown attempts survive later failures. Mutation SDK/HTTP retries are disabled. Even qualified idempotent retries need fresh authorization and physical-attempt evidence. Trusted adapters resolve credential references outside transactions; no public raw secrets or inherited owner credential environment. Fencing external workers blocks Zatiti mutations but cannot prove their processes stopped.

Task success needs independently established acceptance against pinned verifier code/version, sealed inputs and observations. Worker report/exit zero cannot set succeeded. Defaults: one concurrent attempt/worker, four/installation, 30 minutes/attempt, 100 model steps, eight children, delegation depth three, root deadline 24 hours. Configure explicit currency and finite spend limits before paid work. Amounts are int64 micro-units with checked overflow; rational rates use integer numerator/denominator and round reservations upward. Unknown/advisory usage and missing prices are not zero. Children share root and ancestor budgets.

## Wire conventions and limits

UUIDv4 for new identities; stable UUID references thereafter. SHA-256 lowercase hex digests. Versioned canonical JSON sorts keys, rejects duplicate keys/unknown fields, preserves exact integer values and semantic array order; schema-declared sets sort by stable identity. Preserve exact skill bytes. UTC RFC3339Nano timestamps and int64 versions >=1. Patches and snapshots are distinct; explicit delete only. Inert `extensions` alone permits namespaced extra keys. Scope is explicit and every referenced object is revalidated; no implicit global organization.

Default limits: JSON request 1 MiB; chunk 1 MiB decoded; artifact 256 MiB; skill archive 16 MiB compressed, 64 MiB expanded, 4096 entries, depth 32; list 50/max 200; read 1 MiB; redacted log record 8 KiB; event page 100/max 500; upload expiry 24 hours. Narrowing is allowed, increases require authorized configuration. Reject overflow and unsupported bounds.

Mutations require submission_key (1..128 printable ASCII) except one-time init. Bind principal, operation/version and canonical input hash. Retain >=30 days and through unresolved obligations. Replay identical input returns original disposition BEFORE stale-version validation; changed input => submission_conflict. Concurrent duplicates serialize. Recover lost acknowledgements by command lookup, not a new key. Resource updates require expected_version; apply requires base_revision and plan digest. Creation has no existing version. Opaque authenticated cursors bind principal/scope/filter/order/snapshot and expire explicitly with cursor_expired and snapshot_required=true. Event replay cannot silently omit a gap.

HTTP POST `/v1/operations/{operation_id}` uses the common request envelope. Local HTTP runs over a private Unix socket. The Flutter desktop is a direct client of this endpoint: the private Unix socket locally and, for an explicitly configured remote desktop, mutual TLS mapped to current application principals over the same operation contract, never remote MCP. It shares the envelope, fault mapping, limits, submission-key replay and cursor rules with every other client, holds no business logic or database access, and consumes the generated operation catalog rather than any Go package. Completed => HTTP 200; accepted => 202. Failed mapping: invalid_input 400, permission_denied 403, not_found 404, stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict/review_required/outcome_unknown/artifact_fault 409, cursor_expired 410, prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported/verification_failed 422, controller_unavailable 503, internal_error 500. Domain failures always include the result envelope.

CLI completed/accepted => exit 0; invalid_input 2; permission_denied/review_required 3; stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict 4; prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported 5; controller_unavailable/outcome_unknown 6; other failures 1. CLI --json emits one envelope to stdout, diagnostics stderr, no implicit prompts. MCP structuredContent is the full envelope, text is equivalent JSON, failed => isError true, malformed protocol => protocol error. Dot-separated operation IDs map to CLI tokens and `zatiti_` MCP names. Exceptions: installation.init => `zatiti init` / `zatiti_installation_init`; capabilities.list => `zatiti capabilities` / `zatiti_capabilities`. Lifecycle steps are individual tools. Tool input never selects a credential profile or accepts raw secrets/unrestricted server paths.

## Completion policy

Write only within the assigned root. Do not edit this prompt, siblings, shared contracts, root dependencies or external acceptance inputs. Implement exact fake dependencies locally; do not return invented production success for unavailable prerequisites. Use controlled providers, deterministic clocks and synthetic fixtures. Preserve expected/observed results and failure evidence. Package tests prove local properties; actual subprocess parity, crash recovery, desktop and adapter qualification prove integration. Z01-Z21 and first-release journeys on macOS/Linux must pass before a release is claimed.

## Local IO, authentication, jobs and verification seams

These additional declarations are part of the SAME frozen contract package (using imports already shown). Implementing an interface does not permit calling it inside a Unit except where the signature explicitly takes Unit/Reader.

```go

    Authenticate(context.Context, Reader, []byte) (Actor, error)
    AuthenticateCertificate(context.Context, Reader, Digest) (Actor, error)

### Restore protocol (revision 3)

The six-step offline restore protocol (contract-proposals.md section 7) is split across two owners as shipped, not implemented by a single entrypoint-owned capability supplied to `internal/installation` alone: `internal/installation`'s public `installation.restore` operation performs steps 1-3 without ever touching the live database file, and `internal/controller` performs steps 4-6. `installation.restore` runs the same synchronous LocalIO Prepare/Perform/Finish flow as `installation.backup` (`internal/installation/restore.go`): Prepare requires exclusive maintenance, validates the pinned backup artifact and creates the durable job; Perform (outside any transaction) decrypts and verifies the uploaded bundle's binding, integrity and framed image, then — before any rewind — exports a sealed, published `RecoveryOverlay` document of this installation's CURRENT pre-restore state (source database digest from the `DatabaseBackup` capability, plus the obligations `snapshotObligations` captured at Prepare time from pending effects and unresolved memory writes); Finish registers that overlay artifact and leaves the job `running` with an `external_action_required` requirement naming the verified backup image. `internal/installation` never swaps the SQLite file itself: a domain module cannot replace the live database out from under its own open handle mid-process, so the installation stays merely paused, not yet rewound, once `installation.restore` completes.

That handoff is driven forward by `RestoreLifecycle`, declared in `internal/controller` (`internal/controller/restore.go`) — not `contract.SnapshotInventory`/`contract.RestoreCoordinator` as this section previously described; no such contract-package types exist. `RestoreLifecycle` has two methods: `StageCandidate(ctx context.Context, restoreJobID contract.ID, dir string) (RestoreCandidate, error)` resolves the job's already-verified backup artifact into a locally staged, decrypted candidate database file, and `MergeOverlay(ctx context.Context, u contract.Unit, restoreJobID contract.ID) error` folds the already-captured `RecoveryOverlay` into every owner's own tables monotonically — never resurrecting a revoked credential, resending a consumed dispatch or erasing a liability absent from the older snapshot — inside one transaction. It is a field of `controller.Collaborators` (`RestoreLifecycle RestoreLifecycle`), attached through `Controller.Attach` exactly like `Verifier`/`Operator`/`Blobs`: only entrypoint assembly may supply an implementation, because only it has direct Go access to `internal/installation`'s private bundle/key/overlay code, and the controller itself never decrypts a backup bundle or resolves a secret reference. `cmd/zatiti/restore.go` defines the one production implementation (unexported `restoreLifecycle{}`); `cmd/zatiti/serve.go`'s `superviseController` wires it into `Collaborators.RestoreLifecycle` alongside every other trusted collaborator before `ctl.Attach(collab)`.

Once a job reaches `running`/`external_action_required`, the controller's own tick flow claims it and `runRestore` drives the remaining steps: quiesce admission and drain every other in-flight unit (`drainOrdinary`), stage the candidate image via `RestoreLifecycle.StageCandidate` and hand it to `storage.Restorable.PrepareRestore`/`CommitRestore` for the atomic file-level swap and generation advance (`performSwap`), fold the overlay via `RestoreLifecycle.MergeOverlay` inside the transaction `storage.Restorable.WriteRestoreOverlay` opens on the freshly reopened, still-paused database, then call `storage.Restorable.ResumeAfterRestore` to lift the write gate (`mergeAndResume`), and finally report the durable disposition back to `internal/installation` through its own internal `_installation.restore.record` operation (`failRestore`/`settleRestore`). A controller lifetime that itself performs the swap cannot continue afterward: its `*application.Application` was built over the now-closed pre-restore database handle and there is no seam to repoint it, so `Controller.Run` returns the `ErrRestoreHandoff` sentinel error — not a fault — the instant the swap, overlay merge and storage resume are durable. `cmd/zatiti`'s `runServe` is an outer loop around exactly this signal: on `ErrRestoreHandoff` it calls `reassembleAfterRestoreHandoff` (closes the stale `Application` and database, reopens storage at the same path — which already observes the swap — and calls `Database.StartGeneration` again to fence out the lifetime that just ended) under the SAME held installation lock, then runs again. A crash mid-protocol recovers the same way at the next startup: `recoverRestoreBeforeFence` runs before the ordinary generation fence and drives any journal entry left open forward from its last durable phase, re-checking `storage.Restorable.RestorePaused` rather than trusting the last written phase, so it never repeats an already-committed swap or loses track of one.

Current state, honestly: production's only `RestoreLifecycle` implementation, `cmd/zatiti`'s `restoreLifecycle{}`, fails both methods closed with `contract.CodePrerequisiteMissing` rather than guessing or fabricating success — exactly the fallback `Collaborators.RestoreLifecycle`'s own doc comment designs for. `StageCandidate` fails because no operation, public or internal, exposes a pending restore job's original backup-artifact reference to entrypoint assembly (public `job.get`'s wire projection never carries `Input`; only the controller's own internal `_execution.job.claim` call does, and that result stays in the controller's private journal entry). `MergeOverlay` fails because no owner-defined merge operation yet exists in `internal/effects`, `internal/identity` or `internal/memory` to fold a `RecoveryOverlay`'s obligations into their own tables, and because credential/grant revocation obligations are never captured into the overlay to begin with: `snapshotObligations` (`internal/installation/restore.go`) records only `claimed_effect`/`unknown_effect` and `memory_write` obligation kinds. This is a scoped, tracked gap — new merge operations spanning effects/identity/memory, revocation-obligation capture in `snapshotObligations`, a job-input lookup path for `StageCandidate` — not a defect in what shipped: a restore observed without a working merge/staging path is recorded failed with `prerequisite_missing`, and the database is never touched by an incomplete attempt. A clean destination additionally needs a secure key-transfer/provisioning route; an opaque source secret-store reference alone is not portability. Missing required Serenity export guarantees blocks a full-memory backup claim; an empty `Brains` array must never be reported complete.

Identity Service also implements Authenticator. Application receives this interface explicitly in New; it uses a dedicated read snapshot and never reads identity-owned tables itself. Only the byte-slice credential boundary carries secret authentication material, never Invocation JSON. Zero sensitive buffers after use where practical; no logging. Certificate authentication resolves a preprovisioned credential reference and follows the same current principal/revocation rules.

Artifacts, skills, connections and installation Services also implement LocalIO. The registry detects this interface at assembly and routes ONLY registered local IO operations through Prepare/Perform/Finish: artifact.upload.chunk/finish/cancel/read/export; skill.import; connection.setup.begin/complete/cancel; installation.init/backup/restore. LocalIO handles local bounded files, secure helpers and backup work, never unadmitted provider/model calls. Prepare strictly validates input, versions, identity and authority and records replayable local intent under IOPlan.ID; Perform receives that exact trusted in-memory plan outside transactions, resolves opaque staging/helper references, and returns metadata; Finish rechecks authority/versions/generation and commits result/evidence. IOPlan is never public, accepted from an agent or stored with secrets. Prepared/Data JSON must use the operation's declared schemas plus private owner-local metadata, which no other package reads. No cross-owner business protocol may hide in those private fields. Perform must support safe replay of local staging/publication by plan ID, or preserve an inspectable failed/unknown local obligation. A synchronous read does not return bytes to client until final authorization check. New raw provider writes always use effects, not this interface.

For synchronous local IO mutations, persist command identity plus accepted internal pending disposition at Prepare, then replace pending disposition once at Finish. Concurrent same-key calls join/inspect that same in-progress command and never run duplicate Perform. The controller can recover abandoned local intents using the execution job API. Async backup/export uses the same interface with an inspectable job returned immediately. The artifact.upload.chunk endpoint has a 2 MiB encoded request cap (all other ordinary JSON requests 1 MiB), allowing the specified 1 MiB decoded chunk plus envelope.

Execution owns shared durable jobs (execution_jobs), distinct from runs and physical effects. `_execution.job.create` stores the original owner/operation/input and idempotent source identity; public job.get inspects any authorized job. Controller lists pending jobs, claims generation-bound ownership, invokes the named LocalIO owner outside transactions through its exact plan, and records result/obligation. Network jobs first prepare effects and wait on their recorded outcomes. `_execution.job.record` stores result data matching the originating operation's explicit completion_schema and links actual artifact/operation evidence. Never mark a job succeeded merely because its physical request was accepted.

Tasks calls `_execution.enqueue` with ready pinned task inside the same transaction; execution creates one run for task/version and returns it. `_tasks.ready` also exposes a bounded recovery scan. Execution's verifier constructor is `NewVerifier(contract.VerifierDependencies) (contract.Verifier,error)`. Verify executes outside Unit and returns actual independently established observations under the pinned accepted profile; `_execution.verification.record` rechecks attempt/task/version before changing task state. A forged worker-provided VerificationResult is never accepted through public report. Concrete context/adapter/verification payload schemas are included in relevant prompts.

Administrative effects that have no task use their command/operation ID as an accountable admission root; no fictional worker/task or fabricated task foreign key is required. Accounting skips absent scope dimensions but always reserves installation and present organization ancestors/project limits. Task effects additionally share root_task_id. A profile without enforceable charge bounds cannot claim a hard cap.

Typed handler bindings return `contract.Outcome[O]` so accepted results and page cursors survive typed registration. The frozen Bind signature is `Bind[I, O any](contract.Descriptor, func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. Errors carry Fault and roll back, while accepted/completed status and cursor come from Outcome.

Assembly order: application.NewPorts() returns an unbound *PortRouter; For(owner string) returns an owner-bound contract.Ports without domain calls; construct identity and all other modules with those ports, passing installation.WithDatabaseBackup(backup-only wrapper over the opened Database) to installation.New and to no other constructor; registry.New(modules); application.New(db, registry, identityAuthenticator, clock, ids); router.Bind(app) exactly once; start serving only after Bind. PortRouter exposes `For(string) contract.Ports` and `Bind(*Application) error`, rejects pre-bind invocation, and never allows a domain to change its bound caller identity. Registry also implements Module for its own capabilities methods. Constructor execution must not query peers or start goroutines.

All native BlobStore objects are encrypted at rest (including public-classification content), because Stage has no classification argument. Metadata publication sets encrypted=true; classification separately governs disclosure. Controller records the raw adapter observation and cost disposition durably first, then publishes StagedOutput bytes outside Unit, then commits artifact metadata and normalized owner callbacks through an outbox consumer. Publication failure is a visible artifact obligation and blocks task/job acceptance; it does not erase a confirmed provider observation or authorize resending. The adapter cannot mint artifact IDs: AdapterDependencies carries no IDSource and BlobStore.Stage returns only a staging reference, digest and size. The same handoff covers the request record. Each adapter stages its exact secret-free request before sending and names it in `physical_call.request_context` as a staged ArtifactLocator with a matching StagedOutput of purpose context; the controller publishes it with the other staged bytes, for every disposition including not_sent and unknown, and delivers normalized evidence whose request_context is the artifact variant. The raw recorded observation keeps the staged locator and is never rewritten.

Installation alone needs the bytes of a consistent SQLite backup: BackupManifest requires database_digest/database_size and RecoveryOverlay requires source_database_digest, while Dependencies {Clock, IDs, Ports, Secrets, Blobs} deliberately exposes no database. The seam is the DatabaseBackup capability above and these exact declarations in internal/installation: `type Option func(*Service)`; `func WithDatabaseBackup(contract.DatabaseBackup) Option`; `func New(contract.Dependencies, ...Option) (*Service, error)`. `New(deps)` without options stays valid, so the common domain constructor shape holds. Dependencies gains no field and no other module receives the capability. Entrypoint assembly passes a wrapper value whose method set is exactly Backup and which delegates to the opened contract.Database, never the Database value itself; installation must not type-assert the capability to any wider interface or retain it beyond the Service. Installation calls Backup only from LocalIO.Perform for installation.backup and for the pre-restore recovery overlay, never inside a Unit, streaming through a hashing writer into BlobStore.Stage so database_digest/database_size and source_database_digest describe the exact staged bytes without unbounded buffering or a caller-supplied path. The capability grants no query, write, migration, event-feed or file-path access and is not the restore rewind mechanism. When the option is absent, installation.backup and installation.restore fail prerequisite_missing naming the database backup capability; they never fabricate a digest, and every other installation operation is unaffected.

Entrypoint assembly owns platform.Acquire -> storage.Open -> Migrate -> Database.StartGeneration, exactly once before controller/server admission. Pass the held contract.Ownership into controller.New; controller never acquires a second lock or advances generation again. Ownership.Lost closes when ownership is lost/released; stop admission immediately. Generation is a persisted local-controller fence, not distributed locking. The installation lock is retained until controller shutdown and DB close.

Remote TLS additionally validates the certificate chain and maps the SHA-256 certificate SPKI fingerprint through application.AuthenticateCertificate(ctx,Digest), which delegates to identity Authenticator.AuthenticateCertificate on a read snapshot. Only a verified TLS peer can enter that API; operation input cannot supply the fingerprint. Store certificate fingerprints as identity-owned authentication metadata on an explicitly provisioned credential reference. If a bearer credential is also supplied, its principal must match the verified certificate principal. No self-asserted certificate name, profile name or fingerprint header grants authority.

Every async operation declares completion_schema separately from its immediate Job response. job.get returns that schema as Job.result only when established; pending jobs omit result. Local IO mutations that may be recovered asynchronously accept either their completed resource output or `{job: Job}` in the descriptor output schema. Bootstrap remains synchronous under its exclusive one-time lock. No unspecified job kind may execute: _execution.job.create requires a registered completion_schema or a specifically registered private local-intent recovery contract.

Evidence retains the complete original result envelope for command replay, including fault message/details/retryability and cursor; projections of status/data/error_code must agree with Command.result. `_evidence.command.finish` takes that exact result. A replay cannot reconstruct a different error or lose an accepted job reference. ScopeRequired lists installation_id where input scope is required; resource-specific organization/project/worker conditions are enforced by the owned operation schemas and current referenced-resource validation, never inferred from a profile name.

Descriptor.Callers carries the exact catalog internal caller allowlist into runtime registration; application enforces this metadata rather than inventing it from operation names. Internal metadata remains available to trusted assembly/registry while public capability output contains public operations only. An empty allowlist never authorizes an internal call.

## MCP client connection adapter (coordinated revision 2026-09-24)

Founder ruling dec-1256 (hq `designs/2026-09-23-marketer-org-on-zatiti.md`, row Z-M2): Zatiti gains MCP *client* ability as a generic connection adapter, not a per-server package; RFC 2.4's "arbitrary third-party server execution" and social-publishing exclusions are superseded for this adapter only. Postiz (streamable HTTP, Bearer/`pos_` token, 13 tools) is the first qualified server. This section is the coordinated-revision record; the field-level schemas are frozen in `docs/implementation/adapter-schemas.json` under `adapter_mapping.mcpclient` and embedded in the root's generated prompt.

**Root and names.** Go package `internal/adapters/mcpclient` (specgen name `mcpclient`); the wire adapter name in `Tool.adapter`/`Dispatch.Adapter` and the `Connection.provider` value are both `mcp`. The package identifier `mcp` is already `internal/mcp` (the stdio MCP *server* over the controller client); the two are unrelated and neither imports the other. `cmd/zatiti` registers `mcpclient.New` under `"mcp"` beside the four existing constructors; `tests/qualification` gains the root as an import for executable qualification against a controlled server and, once bound, Postiz.

**Profile (`zatiti.mcp/v1`).** One profile is one server: `transport` is a `kind`-discriminated `oneOf` — `streamable_http` with exactly one `https` `endpoint`, `allow_private_endpoint` (explicit installation authorization for loopback/private/link-local, dial addresses bound after validation exactly as httpread does) and `max_redirects` const 0; `stdio` is frozen in shape (absolute `command`, `args`) but a profile naming it fails `capability_unsupported` at construction until a later coordinated revision qualifies subprocess custody. `protocol_version` enum `2025-11-25` | `2026-07-28` (the two versions go-sdk v1.7.0 supports; the server must negotiate the profile's value or `open_session` fails `capability_unsupported`). `credential_kind` is `bearer` or `none`; credential-in-path (`/mcp/:apiKey`) and the OAuth authorization-code flow are refused `capability_unsupported` — the first would put the secret in the staged request record and server logs, the second has no frozen token-endpoint shape (see `cmd/zatiti/helper.go`). `allowed_tools` is the server-level allowlist; `tool_call_cost` (`Money`, may be zero) makes every attempt a `bounded_estimate` charge under ordinary accounting; `max_request_bytes`, `max_response_bytes`, `timeout_seconds`, `classifications` (which classifications may be disclosed as arguments) and `capability_evidence` follow the other adapters.

**Destination policy.** The action never carries a URL. The only destination is the profile endpoint, which the `Connection.destinations` and the tool binding's `destinations` must name; `_connections.resolve` checks them as for every adapter. Redirects are refused; a redirect response is a failed attempt with the location recorded, never followed.

**Actions (`zatiti.mcp.action/v1`, `kind`-discriminated).**
- `open_session` — the MCP handshake as the pinned go-sdk client (v1.7.0) actually performs it: `Client.Connect` first sends a SEP-2575 `server/discover` probe (its protocol-version override is unexported, so this cannot be turned off), then, when the server does not answer it, the legacy `initialize` request and `notifications/initialized`. This is a declared primary-request exception to one-request-per-attempt, bounded and recorded: at most three JSON-RPC messages over at most three HTTP requests, every one listed in `evidence.handshake` with its own `request_sent` and an `http_status` only when a response was received; none carries model-supplied content; protocol/session effects and costs remain within the admitted bounded probe, and the discover probe is never omitted from evidence. The profile's `protocol_version` (`2025-11-25` or `2026-07-28`) is what the server must negotiate; any other negotiated version fails `open_session` as `capability_unsupported`. (Corrected 2026-09-24 from "exactly two" after the Z-M2 lane verified the SDK's Connect path against the source.) The adapter keeps the SDK `ClientSession` in a bounded in-memory table keyed by an opaque `MCPSessionHandle` returned in evidence; the raw `Mcp-Session-Id` never leaves the adapter. A stateless server (no session id) yields `session_state: stateless`. `connection.validate` for provider `mcp` is this action (`buildValidationAction`), recording server name/version/protocol/capabilities as protocol metadata, never as proof of upstream account identity or granted scopes.
- `list_tools` — exactly one `tools/list` request for one page; `next_cursor` is returned, never followed by the adapter. `connection.discover` admits it as a separately authorized `external_read` and its evidence lands through `_connections.discovery.record` (callback route kind `connection`, same as validation), which records name, pinned `input_schema`, `input_schema_digest`, optional `output_schema` and `annotations` per tool into a connections-private table and marks tools absent from a complete catalog as stale. `connection.tools` lists the recorded catalog; it is never a live call.
- `call_tool` — exactly one `tools/call`. The action carries `session_handle`, `tool`, `arguments`, the pinned `input_schema` and its digest, and the `classification` of the arguments. Before any bytes: the tool must be in profile `allowed_tools`, in the connection's recorded discovery with the same digest, and in the calling worker's binding permissions (`_connections.resolve` composes the returned `Tool` from the recorded catalog, so the existing seam returns the concrete pinned schema); arguments validate strictly against that schema (`invalid_input` otherwise); classification must be in profile `classifications`. Initial composed MCP tools use `external_mutation`; lowering that classification requires a separately qualified contract amendment and is not supported by this revision. Server annotations (`read_only_hint` and friends) are recorded as hints and change nothing.
- `close_session` — one HTTP `DELETE`; a server that does not support termination yields a failed attempt with the status recorded, and the local handle is dropped either way.

**Evidence (`zatiti.mcp.evidence/v1`).** `physical_call` as for every adapter (the staged secret-free request record as `request_context`, headers with the Authorization value excluded); `kind`, `session_handle`, `session_state`, `handshake`, server identity/capabilities, `tools`/`next_cursor` (list), `tool`/`arguments_digest`/`is_error`/`content_summary`/`structured_content_digest` (call), `refused_server_requests`, `usage`, and the tool result staged as one `StagedOutput` of purpose `tool_result` under the action's classification. `resource_link` and embedded-resource content items are recorded as opaque references inside that staged result and never fetched; a fetch is a separate governed read.

**Unsupported features are refusals, never inferred success.** Server-to-client requests (sampling, elicitation, roots, ping) receive only JSON-RPC method-not-found replies within the explicit action/profile reply allowance; dispatched refusals are recorded and exhaustion aborts the local session without cleanup traffic. The adapter opens no GET listening stream and never calls resources, prompts or tasks. `Reconcile` is `capability_unsupported` for every kind: the protocol has no authoritative call lookup, so a `call_tool` timeout after bytes were sent, a lost response, or a body above `max_response_bytes` (`error_code: response_oversize`) is `outcome_unknown` with its reservation retained until a separately admitted linked operation resolves it. An unknown `session_handle` (restart, expiry, server 404) is `prerequisite_missing` and `not_sent`; execution opens a new session through a new admitted `open_session`, never inside the failed attempt. SDK retries and reconnects are disabled.

**Phase-0 defects (hq `designs/2026-09-23-zatiti-total-migration-gaps.md`, items 1-2) are routed around, not depended on.** The `connection.setup.complete` receipt-key gap (`cmd/zatiti/helper.go`, `internal/connections/localio.go` reading a literal constant as a secret reference) blocks helper-driven credential capture on a real installation; the adapter root's own proving uses a local fake `SecretStore`, and the real-credential path is Z-M3's (Postiz end to end), which depends on Z-M1.2 or on a verified `connection.create` with the opaque reference `SecretStore.Put` actually returns. The Unix-socket-only CLI/MCP surface is unrelated: this adapter is an outbound client dialing the server's `https` endpoint from the controller, not a listener.

## OpenAI Responses session preparation (revision 3)

The checked-in `internal/adapters/responses` adapter created a provider conversation and then called Responses inside one `Invoke`, which is two physical requests behind a contract that specifies exactly one physical call per claimed effect (audit finding G27). Revision 3 freezes the split into two explicit effects, each making one physical call, with a persisted session handle passed between them:

- `prepare_session` — `kind: "prepare_session"` — creates the provider conversation and returns its authoritative handle as `ResponsesEvidence.session_handle` (a stable provider-issued string, never fabricated locally). **Disclosure:** the action carries no model-visible content beyond what an empty conversation creation requires; no `context_artifact` is sent. **Timeout:** a timeout after the request was sent leaves the session unknown, not absent — the caller must not create a second session on an unconfirmed `prepare_session` outcome; it waits for recovery. **Cost:** session creation itself is not billed by the pinned protocol; usage is `unknown`/advisory only if the provider's behavior deviates from that pin. **Unknown outcome:** if session creation may have succeeded but its response was lost, retain the unknown outcome without resending — a fresh `prepare_session` could create a second, unlinked provider conversation.
- `model_step` — `kind: "model_step"` — names the persisted session handle (`ResponsesParameters.session_handle`, required) and sends the model input (`context_artifact`, `max_output_tokens`, `tool_contract_versions`). **Disclosure:** exactly the pinned `context_artifact`; no other model-visible bytes. **Timeout:** a timeout after bytes were sent is `outcome_unknown`; an empty item list is equally consistent with "never ran" and "still running" (the provider documents no conversation search), so nonexecution is never assumed. **Cost:** reserved against the profile's accepted token bound before dispatch; a lookup that finds output but no usage cannot release the worst-case billing liability, so it stays reserved. **Unknown outcome:** preserved exactly as any other adapter unknown — no automatic fresh call, no silent retry.

`ResponsesParameters` is versioned to require `kind` (`prepare_session` | `model_step`) as a discriminator; `model_step` additionally requires `session_handle`. `session_handle` is scoped to the same conversation/context lineage as the turn that created it and is never reused across turns. P13 implements both translations against the pinned protocol; P15 consumes the resolved handle when preparing a `model_step` action; P12/P23 journal and dispatch each effect separately through the callback-routed `_effects.prepare`/`.record` pipeline above, so a lost `prepare_session` acknowledgement and a lost `model_step` acknowledgement are two independently recoverable unknowns, never conflated into one. Exact `ResponsesParameters`/`ResponsesEvidence` field-level schemas are frozen in `docs/implementation/adapter-schemas.json` and embedded in `internal/adapters/responses`'s generated prompt; this section is the coordinated-revision record for why they carry a `kind` discriminator and a `session_handle`, not a description of a new adapter behavior beyond the split itself.

## Local decision tool schemas (revision 3)

`ReplyProposal { text }`, `ClarifyProposal { question }`, `ReportOutputsProposal { bindings: [{name, artifact}] }` and `CycleDecisionProposal { decision: continue|wait|escalate|done, reason, next_wake? }` are frozen in `docs/implementation/operations.json`'s `$defs` (via `tools/specgen/model.py`) as `LocalDecisionTool`, a `oneOf` over the four. They are the sealed names/inputs contract-proposals.md section 4 requires before P16 interprets model output: execution-local proposals the context builder registers as non-provider tool definitions, never routed through a `connections.Tool`/adapter and never given a provider operation mapping. A final `reply` alone may complete a chat turn; it never implicitly fulfills a task's required outputs, which only `report_outputs` (bound through `_tasks.evidence.record`) can do.


## Revision 4: governed MCP integration

This serialized amendment resolves Z-M2's independent review counterexamples. It does not authorize live Postiz publishing, deployment or release. Affected owners: connections, effects, execution, controller, mcpclient, cmd/zatiti and integration/qualification.

- Startup supplies the same secret-free local MCP profile to connections through `NewWithMCPProfile(Dependencies,json.RawMessage)`. Its digest excludes capability_evidence, exactly as the adapter's existing self-binding digest. No installed profile means MCP admission is unavailable. Every composed MCP action pins profile_digest; the adapter refuses drift before credentials/network. Generic MCP validates transport and the exact opaque credential binding (`credential:<ref>`, or `none`), not an upstream account identity or provider authorization scopes. No provider identity is invented from server metadata.
- Connections creates an exact bounded open_session/list_tools Action using the current configuration revision, reviewed account/endpoint, installed profile cost and reply bounds. `_effects.prepare`, the operation-linked execution job, and an immutable connections-owned intent commit in one transaction. A second outstanding probe refuses. Initial validation requires the matching pending operation/action-digest/connection-version intent at both admission and claim; ordinary calls/discovery retain freshness checks. The adapter does no list_tools automatically after opening a session.
- Callback delivery routes by the persisted job operation. Connections obtains the recorded observation from effects for the exact operation/attempt; it never trusts caller-supplied provider JSON. Only matching intent/account/profile/endpoint/kind can mutate validation/catalog or complete the linked job. Duplicate exact deliveries are idempotent. Successful validation stores the opaque session under the resulting connection version, profile digest and controller generation. Profile change, connection change or restart requires explicit fresh validation/discovery.
- Catalog tools expose their ID/version. Every rediscovery advances catalog version; stale entries cannot resolve. `_connections.tool.resolve` is a context-only exact catalog lookup, not a wildcard dispatch. Execution requires explicitly selected tool and connection bindings and intersecting endpoints. The composed Tool schema is the full MCP envelope: const tool, session, schema/digest, profile digest, restricted classification, and control limit, with arguments validated by the discovered schema. Local JSON pointers are relocated under arguments; unsupported resource IDs/anchors refuse. Model parameters cannot select another schema, session, classification or profile. Admission and claim re-resolve exact catalog/connection versions and validate the whole action; account, endpoint, current policy/configuration, artifacts and full cost bounds remain enforced.
- Effects retains the full governed Action in durable Dispatch. Controller extracts only its validated parameters for the mcp adapter; operation/attempt identity, credential reference and deadline remain unchanged. No additional provider request is created by translation.
- MCP actions carry optional control_reply_limit (absent means zero), capped at sixteen and by installed profile max_control_replies (absent means zero). Nonzero allowance requires same-currency control_reply_cost; overflow refuses. Replies are only JSON-RPC method-not-found refusals, with no sampling, elicitation, roots, ping work or tool calls. They are explicitly bounded sub-exchanges of the admitted effect, not retries or independent authority. Reserve base tool_call_cost plus maximum reply allowance before dispatch; evidence accounts the replies actually dispatched separately and includes their liability even on lost response. Unused slots do not count as dispatched. Exhaustion aborts the local session without an automatic DELETE; incomplete primary outcomes remain unknown. This replaces the incompatible blanket 'exactly one total HTTP request while answering every callback' requirement: one primary tools/list or tools/call, or up to three distinct handshake requests, plus only the explicitly admitted refusal allowance.
- Every captured HTTP exchange has an ordinal, kind (main/handshake/control_reply), HTTP method, optional RPC method, request context, request-sent knowledge and optional actual status. At most nineteen exchanges and twenty staged outputs (including one tool result). Every staged request context is published, not only the first. A base-transport error without response records request_sent unknown, never invented status or certain nonexecution. Handshake evidence retains all exchanges even without responses.
- MCP physical request_context is omitted only when request_sent=no and context_unavailable records staging_failed, request_rejected or cancelled_before_send. An empty/fabricated artifact locator is forbidden. This MCP-specific evidence variant does not relax other adapters' evidence contracts. Pre-send refusal carries no provider effect; partial/sent attempts retain their actual exchange evidence and unknown liability.

Executable regression coverage must include unverified bootstrap through effects and callback, forged/replayed/stale intent rejection, catalog mutation between admit/claim, full-envelope tampering, lost handshake response, staged-context failure, callback bounds zero/one/sixteen and overflow with server-counted requests. Controlled fixtures are not live-provider or release qualification.

Revision 4 integration details: a connections callback uses the recorded effects observation for outcome and provenance. If the observation contains staged outputs, the owner verifies the controller's publication mapping against artifact metadata (scope, digest, size, media type, classification and availability), reconstructs only the permitted locator substitutions, and persists that normalized recorded evidence. Callback-supplied outcome, usage or tool facts never replace recorded truth. The controller defers an explicit connection callback operation before admission if its linked job is absent from the current bounded scan; absence is not permission to discard the callback. Generic MCP cannot attest same-account credential rotation: `connection.rotate` returns `capability_unsupported` for MCP and leaves any existing intent untouched; a separately reviewed connection is required.

## Owned product requirements

### R4-002 (source section 4; primary owner contract)

| Entity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Installation | One administrative trust and storage boundary |
| Principal | Authenticated human, client agent, worker, or service identity |
| Organization | Versioned responsibility scope with one chief, optional parent, shared memory, and inherited authority and budget ceilings |
| Responsibility | Ongoing outcome mandate with an owner, triggers, reasoning policy, limits, and review criteria; creates bounded tasks |
| Memory binding | Explicit read, write, or promotion access to a worker, organization, or installation Serenity brain |
| Autonomy qualification | Evidence-backed permission eligibility for an exact capability, scope, and execution configuration |
| Team | Organizational grouping; membership alone grants no authority |
| Project | Explicit repository, data, connection, artifact, and budget scope |
| Worker | Persistent identity, purpose, instructions, skills, tool bindings, execution profile, limits, and delegation rules |
| Skill version | Immutable instructional package with schemas, requirements, provenance, and evaluation references |
| Tool contract | Typed operation, effect classification, input/output schemas, provider behavior, and recovery rules |
| Connection | Named provider/account identity, credential reference, allowed destinations/scopes, and validation state |
| Binding | Explicit attachment of a tool, skill, connection, worker, or repository to a permitted scope |
| Configuration plan | Exact proposed definition changes, expected revision, dependencies, authority delta, and required decisions |
| Task | Desired outcome, owner, assignee, inputs, dependencies, acceptance contract, and limits |
| Run / run attempt | One task execution / one executor lifetime within it |
| Operation / operation attempt | One logical protected effect / one physical provider invocation |
| Review / decision | A request for an exact action / an immutable eligible principal response |
| Artifact / event | Immutable output bytes / an observed state transition or fact |

### R4-003 (source section 4; primary owner contract)

Use stable UUID identities, explicit enums, UTC timestamps, and monotonically increasing resource versions. Human-readable keys resolve within explicit organization/project scope. Every public mutation validates the referenced objects and current scope. Missing scope is an error when ambiguous; an implicit global organization is not selected on an agent's behalf.

### R4-004 (source section 4; primary owner contract)

Proposed Go ownership boundaries are `identity`, `configuration`, `skills`, `connections`, `policy`, `tasks`, `execution`, `accounting`, `artifacts`, and `evidence`, with transport and platform packages around them. Application services compose transactions through owner methods. A module does not mutate another owner's tables through raw SQL. Add packages when behavior warrants them, not merely to mirror this table.

### R9-002 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Tasks pin an accountable principal, organization/project, assigned worker, outcome, input artifacts, required outputs, acceptance contract and resource envelope. Acceptance identifies verifier code/version, sealed inputs, expected observations and whether independent verification or authorized manual acceptance is required. Workers may propose contracts, but cannot replace their task's accepted verifier during execution.

### R9-003 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Task states are `draft`, `ready`, `running`, `waiting`, `verifying`, `succeeded`, `failed`, and `cancelled`. Waiting includes explicit dependencies, human decisions, prerequisites and recovery owners. Cancellation records intent first; terminal cancellation requires owned execution to stop or be conclusively fenced, and unresolved effects remain visible separately. A worker report and process exit do not independently set `succeeded`.

### R9-004 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Runs pin effective configuration and input versions. Each run attempt has one executor, lease, generation, heartbeat, resource reservation and output disposition. Retrying creates a new attempt; it cannot silently change the accepted task contract. A failed verification cannot release dependents whose acceptance requires verified success. A manual acceptance decision remains labeled manual rather than represented as automated proof.

### R9-005 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Zatiti owns the model loop used by chiefs and ongoing responsibilities. Specialist tasks may use external harness adapters under the same task and effect contracts. Adapters declare supported capabilities, including checkpointing, continuation, interruption, context capture, and cost reporting; unsupported guarantees fail explicitly rather than being inferred from a harness name. An external harness does not own a second copy of Zatiti's task graph.

### R9-006 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

The initial executors are:

### R9-007 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

- **Hosted loop:** a configured provider adapter runs bounded model steps with only the declared tools and credential broker. Model calls, disclosure and costs follow the same scope and accounting rules.
- **Cooperative external worker:** an authorized client claims work, receives pinned task context and lease identity, sends heartbeats/checkpoints, proposes governed effects, and submits artifacts and completion observations. Zatiti verifies the submitted result independently. The worker's external shell, network and billing remain advisory unless a separately qualified execution boundary contains them.

### R9-008 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Claim/heartbeat/report APIs bind the worker, attempt and generation. Concurrent claims cannot create two current owners. Lease expiry fences future Zatiti mutations but does not prove the old process stopped; a replacement waits for explicit recovery disposition of conflicting resources and possible external effects. A caller cannot report for another attempt or turn a stale result into current completion.

### R9-009 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Schedules reference pinned task templates, explicit time zones, occurrence keys, and misfire rules. Default missed occurrences coalesce once within a configured catch-up window; pause disables admission. Daylight-saving changes and repeated polling cannot duplicate an admitted occurrence. Conditions such as cancellation or a recorded reply are checked transactionally at wake. v1 reply conditions use explicit authenticated events; external chat-channel intake is a later adapter.

### R9-010 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Child tasks inherit intersected authority, project data, deadlines and root budgets. Parent completion criteria explicitly state which child outcomes are required. Delegation depth, child count, concurrency, planner steps and wall time are finite. No nested fleet scheduler may claim ownership of the same Zatiti task graph.

### R9-011 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Responsibilities support both durable schedules/event subscriptions and repeated reasoning. A responsibility records what outcome to pursue, what signals to inspect, when to reconsider, its finite per-cycle and aggregate spending limits, and conditions for pausing or escalating. Reasoning cycles may discover and propose useful work even without a new external event. Every cycle is a bounded admitted run with a durable next-wake decision, a minimum reconsideration interval, and accountable outputs; an idle loop cannot spend indefinitely or silently create unbounded tasks. The operator can pause a responsibility without cancelling unrelated work.

### R9-012 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

Agent messages use durable mailboxes with sender, recipient, organization scope, task references, and stable message identity. Receipt is acknowledged only after durable target admission; redelivery deduplicates by identity. Running workers receive admitted messages at a safe step boundary, and idle workers can be resumed. Coordination messages and unsolicited context remain untrusted observations, never replacement authority. Direct user instructions and chief assignments converge on versioned tasks so concurrent conversations cannot silently overwrite responsibility.

### R9-013 (source section 9; primary owner tasks)

For the owned loop, every model-visible input must be reconstructable from persisted context: user messages, tool definitions and results, memory excerpts, effective instructions, and injected agent messages. Persist the request context before model dispatch and the protected effect intent before tool dispatch. Compaction retains lineage to its source context. External executors declare the limits of their context capture; Zatiti must not advertise exact transcript replay when an adapter cannot supply it.

### P00-001 (source section P00; primary owner execution)

Execution owns a durable WorkerTurn per worker/task/message/responsibility decision stream, keyed by unique (installation_id, source_kind, source_id, source_version, recipient_worker_id). _execution.turn.admit is idempotent: re-admission for the same source identity returns the existing turn rather than creating a second one. A pending inbox message and its turn admission/processed marker commit in one shared transaction; a message arriving during an active turn is admitted as a safe-boundary injection durably linked to that turn, never silently dropped or processed twice.

### P00-004 (source section P00; primary owner tasks)

task.start transitions an eligible draft/ready task to ready and enqueues its run in the same transaction, distinct from task.create (which stays draft-only) and task.assign (which only changes worker/version). _tasks.evidence.record binds trusted verifier evidence to the pinned acceptance digest and named output bindings before any task state depends on it; only this recorded lineage, or eligible explicit manual acceptance, ever establishes succeeded. _tasks.dependencies.wake bounded-scans dependents of a just-completed task and revalidates each dependent's current eligibility; it never reports success for a dependent whose required child failed.

### P00-010 (source section P00; primary owner tasks)

An accepted output slot freezes name, classification, media type, max bytes and check definition (artifact_presence/json_schema/artifact_digest), never unknowable generated bytes. On report, the runtime binds each slot to a published artifact from that attempt and seals the verification request; after binding, bytes/digests cannot change and the accepted task/criterion digest stays immutable throughout. VerificationRequest.Outputs is populated from those bindings; a report that omits a required output slot never reaches succeeded.

### P00-016 (source section P00; primary owner tasks)

task.assign is a public operation and carries no internal caller allowlist; the registry rejects any public descriptor declaring callers. A chief-driven assignment is an ordinary authenticated task.assign call made through the worker operation executor under the requesting worker's own actor, never a domain-internal caller path from messaging or any other owner.

### `task.retry` v1 — tasks / public / mutation / local

CLI `zatiti task retry`; MCP `zatiti_task_retry`. Submission key: required.

Cancel first records intent and blocks new work; terminal only after owned execution stops or is conclusively fenced, retaining unresolved effects. Retry creates new run attempt under unchanged acceptance and requires safe replacement disposition.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"expected_version":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":9223372036854775807},"reason":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192}},"required":["scope","id","expected_version","reason"]}
```
Output data schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"resource":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Task"}},"required":["resource"]}
```

### `task.start` v1 — tasks / public / mutation / local

CLI `zatiti task start`; MCP `zatiti_task_start`. Submission key: required.

Transition an eligible draft/ready task to ready and enqueue its run in the same transaction; existing draft-only task.create stays compatible and task.assign continues to only change worker/version without readying. Reject a task with unresolved required dependencies or missing acceptance/verifier prerequisites; replay of the same submission key returns the original disposition.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"expected_version":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":9223372036854775807}},"required":["scope","id","expected_version"]}
```
Output data schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"task":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Task"},"run":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Run"}},"required":["task","run"]}
```

### `task.update` v1 — tasks / public / mutation / local

CLI `zatiti task update`; MCP `zatiti_task_update`. Submission key: required.

Update only pending draft/ready input under version check; accepted verifier cannot be changed during execution.

Input schema:
```json
{"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{"scope":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Scope"},"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"expected_version":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":9223372036854775807},"inputs":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/$defs/ArtifactRef"},"maxItems":4096},"outcome":{"type":"string","maxLength":8192}},"required":["scope","id","expected_version","inputs"]}

### Local schema definitions

The schemas above resolve exclusively against this embedded `$defs` object. Input objects reject additional properties except explicitly open schema/data fields. Field semantics are completed by the owned requirements and operation descriptions. Output `resource`, `items`, `draft`, `job`, etc. are literal keys. Pagination cursor lives in the common envelope.

## Local adapter, context, verifier and backup payloads

These local schemas freeze the handoff between execution, adapters and artifact publication. They do not assert upstream compatibility.

These are exact Zatiti-side contracts, not representations of upstream APIs. Adapter implementation translates to a pinned, separately qualified public upstream protocol; unsupported semantics fail capability_unsupported or preserve outcome_unknown.
To validate a named schema, place definitions under the root $defs and reference the selected name. The catalog container uses definitions for packaging only; every embedded #/$defs/Name resolves against that assembled validation document. JSON Schema dialect is 2020-12.
Validate strict objects, formats, explicit field limits, duplicate-key rejection and exact integer bounds. Runtime must also enforce total JSON/artifact byte limits, at most 64 JSON levels and 100000 schema/input nodes; schema documents and dynamic tool arguments cannot escape the qualified local validation dialect.
Opaque references, URLs, headers and diagnostics must never contain secret bytes. Profile configuration is trusted local configuration; public operation arguments cannot install profiles, select a more privileged credential, open an arbitrary server path or replace capability evidence.
Before dispatch, profile capability evidence must match the canonical profile digest computed with the capability_evidence field omitted; self-referential capability evidence and qualification records do not grant authority. The binding/effect owner independently checks current account, scope, destinations, classification, prices and qualified capability.
PhysicalCallEvidence records exactly one physical network request per claimed attempt. request_context is an ArtifactLocator that identifies the pre-dispatch persisted request. An adapter receives no IDSource and BlobStore mints no artifact identity, so an adapter never fabricates an ArtifactRef and never reuses capability_evidence or any other unrelated artifact as a stand-in. Before writing any request bytes, the adapter stages the exact bounded request record (method, destination, permitted headers and body as sent, with credentials and every secret excluded) through BlobStore.Stage and returns request_context as kind staged with that staging_ref and digest, plus exactly one matching StagedOutput with purpose context in the same observation. If staging fails, the adapter sends nothing. Kind artifact is allowed at adapter return only to pass through, unchanged, a published ArtifactRef received in Dispatch.Action whose bytes already are the complete request record, for example ResponsesParameters.context_artifact when the translated provider request adds nothing model-visible beyond the persisted Action. ModelOutput.request_context equals physical_call.request_context. Reconcile is its own physical call with its own request_context. A not_sent, failed or unknown attempt keeps its staged request context. No adapter adds preflight, redirect, polling, SDK retry or model tool execution inside that request; each such external action requires a separate governed attempt.
StagedOutput is an IO handoff, not a published ArtifactRef. Adapter stages bytes and returns staging_ref/digest metadata; controller uses the artifacts owner to publish metadata and replace staged locators with real ArtifactRefs before delivering normalized observations to execution/memory/other domains. output_artifacts may be empty at adapter return and contains the resulting published refs in recorded domain evidence. ArtifactLocator staged references, including physical_call.request_context and ModelOutput.request_context, must match exactly one StagedOutput in the same observation. The controller is responsible for publishing the staged request context with every other StagedOutput and for replacing the staged locator with kind artifact and the published ArtifactRef in the normalized evidence it delivers; the raw recorded adapter observation is not rewritten. Owners receiving normalized evidence accept only kind artifact for request_context and treat a staged locator there as an unpublished obligation, not success. HTTPReadEvidence therefore allows two staged outputs and two output artifacts: the request context and at most one response body. Failed publication remains a visible obligation/fault.
ContextArtifact.messages and each parts array preserve the exact model-visible semantic order. Tool definitions, memory excerpts and injected messages must all appear in the persisted request context before dispatch. Context source artifacts and compaction lineage do not replace retaining the actual selected text. Complete capture is required for owned hosted loops; external capture limitations remain explicit.
Model tool proposals are observations. tool ID/version must match the pinned context tool closure; operation ID/version must be the qualified mapping for that tool. Validate input against that exact schema and apply current authority/review/budgets before a separate operation. Never execute a model proposal directly in an adapter.
Responses input_rate.unit must equal input_token and output_rate.unit output_token; profile currencies and all reported/reserved usage must agree. Round admission reservations upward using checked integer rational arithmetic. Missing or unbounded required charges refuse hard-cap mode. A null/absent upstream usage report maps to unknown/advisory billing, never free success.
GitHubParameters is discriminated by kind. read_repository requires branch for ref, sha for commit/tree/blob, and pull_request_number for pull_request; irrelevant resource selectors are rejected. Relative repository paths and branch syntax receive Git-aware validation. Profile allowed_actions must be separately qualified against real API preconditions and downstream automation.
GitHub push_commit publishes an already prepared exact commit SHA in one qualified physical request. Creating remote blobs, trees or commits is not hidden inside Invoke: it needs an explicit separately admitted decomposition and qualification before enabling that route. Preflight evidence cannot substitute for atomic provider preconditions where the action requires protection against a race; refuse unsupported guarantees.
GitHub open_pull_request and merge_pull_request are consequential effects bound to exact account/repository/head/base/content/timing/automation constraints. A successful HTTP response or accepted request is not independently assumed confirmed completion; response interpretation follows the qualified contract. Eventual not-found never proves nonexecution.
HTTPRead v1 max_redirects is exactly zero. Return redirect_location as evidence/prerequisite and require a separately authorized read for the new URL. Validate DNS results and bind validated dial addresses; reject local/private/link-local/metadata targets unless explicitly permitted by an installation-authorized destination binding. Header values reject controls and duplicate header names; Authorization, Cookie and arbitrary raw credential input are excluded.
Serenity profile endpoints/root_ref/writer_owner are opaque locally provisioned mappings, not model-selectable arbitrary filesystem locations. They identify real pinned public protocol/read-facade support. Zatiti never imports upstream internal packages or invents public endpoints from these local operation names.
Serenity recall/remember/promote may incur disclosure or charges. All nested upstream provider destinations and spend must fit enforcement; unsupported enforceable bounds disable the mode or require explicitly permitted advisory use. Promote resolves and authorizes source content before preparing the destination write and retains the source evidence; it does not perform an unaccounted extra source read inside Invoke.
Serenity adapter_command_id is the durable pre-dispatch command identity. Its existence does not prove upstream idempotency: reconcile through qualified status semantics, retaining unknown after lost acknowledgement if authoritative lookup is unavailable. One writer owner per brain. Retract removes active recall and leaves historical_erasure false; promotion correction lineage remains a durable memory-owner obligation.
Verification profiles are installation-owned and pinned before task execution. command_id, runner_profile and environment_profile resolve only to prequalified local verifiers; no request supplies executable paths or argv. ArtifactVerifierProfile runs presence/digest/schema checks; RepositoryVerifierProfile runs the pinned controlled patch/check profile outside Unit. A worker cannot alter profile bytes, accepted inputs or result authority.
VerificationResult.independent=true is necessary structure, not trust evidence: only the trusted runner may submit that result through its internal admission identity. Match task/attempt, acceptance digest, verifier identity/version/digest and request artifact before accepting. Passed requires all sealed expected checks observed as required; unavailable, interrupted, worker assertion and process exit zero alone cannot succeed a task. Manual acceptance uses the separate task operation and never fabricates an independent result.
BackupManifest is inside an authenticated encrypted bundle; it never includes decrypting master keys. archive_entry values are normalized relative entries with no traversal, absolute paths, symlinks, duplicate/case collisions or devices. Verify database/artifact/brain digests and qualified revision exports before marking backup verified. Large manifests stream through bounded artifact IO, not public JSON request bodies.
Restore starts paused under exclusive maintenance, validates installation binding and key prerequisites, and retains current recovery overlay before rewinding. Merge revocations, durable command identities, claimed/unknown effects, reservations and memory obligations monotonically via their owners; fail closed on conflict and retain the overlay. Overlay record artifacts must be included/pinned and encrypted. No database/brain rewind is represented as undoing an external effect.
Revision 3 splits ResponsesParameters/ResponsesEvidence by the kind discriminator into prepare_session (creates the provider conversation, returns session_handle, no model-visible content and no context_artifact) and model_step (names the persisted session_handle and sends context_artifact/max_output_tokens/tool_contract_versions). Each is exactly one physical call per Invoke; the adapter never performs both requests inside one Invoke. A prepare_session timeout after the request was sent leaves the session unknown, not absent, and must not be resent; a model_step timeout after bytes were sent is outcome_unknown and an empty item list is equally consistent with never ran and still running, so nonexecution is never assumed and no automatic fresh call follows.
MCP client adapter (internal/adapters/mcpclient, adapter name mcp, coordinated revision 2026-09-24, dec-1256): open_session is the one declared exception to one-request-per-attempt, and it is bounded and recorded: the pinned go-sdk client sends at most three JSON-RPC messages over at most three HTTP requests (an optional SEP-2575 server/discover probe, then the legacy initialize request and notifications/initialized when the server does not answer discover), every one listed in evidence.handshake with request_sent and the actual http_status only when a response exists (a sent request with no response has no status), none carrying model-supplied content or causing an external effect. The adapter never hides the discover probe from evidence. list_tools, call_tool and close_session are exactly one request each; a tools/list page is one attempt and the adapter never follows next_cursor itself. Server-to-client requests (sampling, elicitation, roots, ping) are answered with a JSON-RPC method-not-found error and named in refused_server_requests; the adapter opens no GET listening stream and never calls resources, prompts or tasks. Discovered tools, schemas and annotations are untrusted data recorded through _connections.discovery.record; they grant no authority, and a call_tool is admitted only for a tool named in the profile allowed_tools, the connection's recorded discovery and the calling worker's binding permissions, with arguments validated against the pinned input_schema whose digest the action carries.

## Named acceptance cases

Tests are implementation deliverables, not claims of already executed qualification. Retain expected/observed results, exact source/config/tool versions and failure evidence.

### Z03.agent_setup_mcp — Z03

Setup: A clean installation and scoped client-agent profile exist; paid execution is initially unavailable.

Action: Using MCP discovery alone, create an organization and workers, import/evaluate a skill, set up and validate a connection, resolve prerequisites, plan/apply and start work.

Expected:

- The complete authorized setup succeeds without dashboard or repository-source knowledge.
- A verified output artifact is inspectable; paid work remains refused until provider, currency and limits are configured.
- Credential prerequisites return actionable challenges without secret bytes in model-visible input or output.

### Z03.agent_setup_cli — Z03

Setup: Create a fixture equivalent to the MCP setup case with the same authority.

Action: Perform the complete discovery, organization/skill/worker/connection, prerequisite, activation and first-work journey using CLI JSON mode.

Expected:

- The CLI completes the same lifecycle and produces equivalent authorized state and verified output.
- No TTY or silent prompt is required; incomplete input returns a structured actionable result.

### Z04.explicit_removal — Z04

Setup: An active configuration contains workers, projects and retained obligations.

Action: Apply a patch omitting an object, then explicitly remove/archive an object that owns active work or unknown effects.

Expected:

- Omission does not delete live objects.
- Explicit removal first disables new work and requires archival disposition or refuses destructive removal while obligations remain.
- Artifacts, operation uncertainty and accounting obligations are not discarded.

### Z08.cancel_unknown — Z08

Setup: An effect is already claimed and may have reached its provider.

Action: Cancel the task or operation and acknowledge the uncertainty as an operator.

Expected:

- Cancellation records restrictive intent but does not reclassify the possibly sent attempt as unsent.
- Unknown outcomes and reservations remain inspectable until supported evidence resolves them.

### Z09.concurrent_reservations — Z09

Setup: Installation, ancestor organizations, project, worker and root-task budgets are nearly exhausted.

Action: Concurrently admit child tasks, evaluation and model calls competing for the remaining funds.

Expected:

- Atomic reservations across all applicable scopes prevent overcommit and use deterministic lock/update order.
- Children and retries consume shared root/ancestor limits rather than independent copies.

### Z10.stale_heartbeat — Z10

Setup: An attempt lease/generation is stale after expiry or controller restart.

Action: Send heartbeat, checkpoint and completion report from that stale owner or a different worker.

Expected:

- Stale or mismatched worker/attempt/generation requests cannot mutate current execution or complete the task.
- Lease expiry alone does not assert that the old external process stopped.

### Z10.cancelled_wake — Z10

Setup: A task is durably waiting for a timer or authenticated reply event.

Action: Commit cancellation or a qualifying reply concurrently with wake evaluation.

Expected:

- Wake conditions are checked transactionally.
- Cancelled work is not readmitted; a reply already recorded does not cause duplicate or obsolete wake work.

### Z11.exit_zero_missing_output — Z11

Setup: A task requires independently verified artifacts.

Action: Have its worker exit successfully or report success while omitting required output bytes.

Expected:

- Task does not enter succeeded.
- Missing artifacts produce a visible fault and dependents requiring verified success remain blocked.

### Z11.tampered_verifier — Z11

Setup: A task pins verifier code/version, sealed inputs and expected observations.

Action: Modify verifier bytes/version or attempt to replace acceptance during the run or retry.

Expected:

- Verification rejects a mismatched or unapproved verifier/contract.
- A worker cannot weaken the accepted contract during execution; retries retain it.

### Z11.worker_assertion — Z11

Setup: A worker submits plausible narrative success and self-generated tests.

Action: Report completion without independently accepted check evidence.

Expected:

- Worker assertions are recorded as observations rather than proof.
- Independent verification or an authorized explicitly manual acceptance is still required.

### Z11.failed_child_acceptance — Z11

Setup: A parent acceptance contract requires a designated child to pass independent checks.

Action: Have that child finish execution but fail verification.

Expected:

- The parent and dependent tasks do not satisfy verified-success conditions.
- Failed child acceptance and its evidence remain visible.

### Z11.manual_acceptance_label — Z11

Setup: A task contract permits eligible manual acceptance and has no passing automated result.

Action: Accept using the eligible principal, then inspect CLI/MCP results and evidence.

Expected:

- Acceptance remains explicitly labeled manual.
- The product never presents manual approval as successful independent automated verification.

### Z12.delegation_narrows — Z12

Setup: A root task has finite scope, allowed tools/destinations, project data, deadline and shared budget.

Action: Independently delegate children expanding scope, tool access, data access, deadline or spending authority.

Expected:

- Each expansion is refused or reduced only through an explicit valid narrowing contract.
- Delegation cannot grant authority absent from its parent or inherited organization policy.

### Z12.root_limits_shared — Z12

Setup: A root task is configured with finite child count, depth, concurrency, planner steps and wall-time limits.

Action: Delegate concurrently and recursively until each limit is reached.

Expected:

- All branches share root budgets and finite limits; limits cannot be reset by making another child.
- Default limits match one worker attempt, four installation attempts, 30 minutes per attempt, 100 steps, eight children, depth three and a 24-hour root deadline where applicable.

### Z14.missing_artifact — Z14

Setup: Metadata references a committed content hash whose bytes are missing or corrupt.

Action: Read the artifact, verify its task and create or inspect a backup.

Expected:

- A visible integrity/artifact fault is returned.
- The missing output is never a successful task result or silently accepted backup; unreferenced staging bytes can be reclaimed separately.

### Z17.chief_replacement — Z17

Setup: An organization has a designated chief, shared memory, responsibilities, pending decisions and history.

Action: Replace its chief using an authorized exact configuration plan.

Expected:

- The organization keeps its identity, memory, obligations and history.
- Exactly one active chief remains; replacement does not silently grant private memories or excess authority.

### Z17.ancestor_budget_exhaustion — Z17

Setup: A child has local funds but an applicable ancestor budget is exhausted.

Action: Admit a paid child task or model call.

Expected:

- Admission is refused without provider dispatch.
- Every descendant reserves against applicable ancestor budgets and cannot bypass an exhausted aggregate limit.

### Z17.scoped_reparenting — Z17

Setup: A worker or organization with active work and private memory is moved between scopes with different ceilings.

Action: Apply the move through a configuration plan.

Expected:

- Inherited authority, budgets and memory bindings are rechecked.
- Existing private memories are not silently transferred and active work does not acquire broader authority.

### Z18.stale_index — Z18

Setup: A permitted brain has an index behind the required source revision or a failed writer.

Action: Recall for a task requiring current freshness and inspect memory status.

Expected:

- Results report source/scope/version/confidence/freshness where available.
- The task waits or receives a named prerequisite failure rather than silently treating stale content as current; failed writes are not presented as remembered knowledge.

### Z19.unsupported_evidence — Z19

Setup: An owner-approved promotion rule requires independently established results in a specified evidence window.

Action: Submit model assertions, unverified worker tests, stale evidence or provenance-free memory claims as proof.

Expected:

- Insufficient evidence is rejected with an inspectable explanation.
- No grant activates solely from competence narration or a remembered judgment.

### Z20.scheduled_cycles — Z20

Setup: A responsibility specifies scheduled/event triggers, finite cycle/root limits, timezone and catch-up window.

Action: Trigger normal, missed and duplicated occurrences and an authenticated event.

Expected:

- Each admitted cycle is bounded and linked to the responsibility; repeated polls/events do not duplicate task admission.
- Default missed occurrences coalesce once within the configured window and pauses disable new admission.

### Z20.reasoning_cycles — Z20

Setup: An active responsibility permits repeated reasoning without new external events and has a minimum reconsideration interval.

Action: Run a reasoning cycle that proposes useful work, then inspect its next wake and outputs.

Expected:

- The cycle is an admitted bounded run with accountable outputs and a persisted next-wake decision.
- Proposed work converges on versioned tasks and stays within task-count, scope and spending limits.

### Z20.duplicate_assignment_conflict — Z20

Setup: Direct user and chief conversations reference the same durable task/version.

Action: Submit conflicting assignment or pending-input updates concurrently.

Expected:

- One accepted version is authoritative and the conflicting update is surfaced.
- The system does not independently schedule duplicate work from the competing conversations.

### Z20.responsibility_pause — Z20

Setup: Two responsibilities have active/queued work and only one is selected for pause.

Action: Pause that responsibility and race its next wake.

Expected:

- Restrictive state commits immediately and prevents new admission for that responsibility.
- Unrelated work is not cancelled; already transmitted effects and unresolved outcomes remain visible.

### Z21.delegate_work — Z21

Setup: A real desktop session has personal, marketing and engineering chiefs plus ordinary workers.

Action: Assign a bounded task and an ongoing responsibility, delegate work, then inspect a produced result.

Expected:

- The UI exposes durable task/responsibility state, required outputs and acceptance evidence outside message narration.
- Failed checks cannot be represented as successful completion; the responsibility remains independently pausable.

### JOURNEY.organization_setup_cli — JOURNEY

Setup: Use a fresh controlled installation and scoped external agent principal.

Action: Discover capabilities, create an organization and two workers, import/evaluate a skill, establish a provider connection, plan/apply and complete first work entirely through CLI.

Expected:

- The first artifact is independently verified and inspectable.
- Provider secrets never enter agent-visible arguments/results; prerequisite resolution requires no dashboard or source knowledge.
- Retain operation traces, state/event observations and verification artifacts.

### JOURNEY.organization_setup_mcp — JOURNEY

Setup: Use a matching fresh installation with a scoped agent MCP client.

Action: Perform the full organization, two-worker, skill evaluation, provider setup, activation and first verified artifact journey entirely through MCP.

Expected:

- The same authorized product lifecycle and evidence is obtained as through CLI.
- Every prerequisite and long-running operation remains discoverable and inspectable without optional MCP features.

### JOURNEY.engineering_cli — JOURNEY

Setup: A controlled repository has an explicit base head, policy, cooperative worker and independent sealed verifier.

Action: Through CLI, claim work, checkpoint, submit a patch and independent check evidence, then propose exact repository publication; also run failed-check and stale-head variants.

Expected:

- Successful acceptance is independently established and publication is governed by exact repository/branch/head/change/automation constraints.
- Failed checks block completion and stale head invalidates applicable review.
- Opening a pull request is not automatically treated as harmless when downstream automation broadens consequences.

### JOURNEY.engineering_mcp — JOURNEY

Setup: Use matching repository, worker, policy and sealed verification fixtures.

Action: Perform claim, checkpoint, patch/evidence submission and exact publication proposal entirely through MCP, including failed checks and stale head.

Expected:

- The same verified acceptance and protected-effect lifecycle is observed as through CLI.
- No arbitrary shell invocation exposed as an MCP substitute counts toward operation parity.

### JOURNEY.research_drafting_cli — JOURNEY

Setup: A hosted worker has an authorized model profile, bounded public HTTP destinations and finite cost/disclosure limits.

Action: Through CLI assign research, gather controlled public sources, produce a cited brief and draft artifact and inspect verification.

Expected:

- The hosted loop uses governed bounded reads/model calls and retains reconstructable context and source references.
- Artifacts satisfy acceptance and no social publishing adapter is required.

### JOURNEY.research_drafting_mcp — JOURNEY

Setup: Use matching hosted worker, public source fixtures and policy limits.

Action: Perform the research and cited-brief/draft workflow entirely through MCP.

Expected:

- The same scope, disclosure, accounting, context and artifact guarantees are observed as through CLI.
- Long-running work is followed through durable task/command IDs and polling.

### JOURNEY.desktop_daily_work — JOURNEY

Setup: Launch the actual packaged desktop on a supported platform with a personal-chief conversation.

Action: Create marketing/engineering organizations and ordinary workers, assign a bounded task and ongoing responsibility, inspect result and memory, then handle an exact pending decision.

Expected:

- The visible hierarchy and work states match queried controller state rather than model narration.
- Memory scope/lineage and earned autonomy meet their own Z18/Z19 gates.
- Capture executed UI observations for setup and daily results/decisions; mocked view models alone are insufficient.

### P00.task_start_readies_and_enqueues — P00

Setup: A draft task exists with satisfied dependencies, a pinned acceptance contract and no run.

Action: Call task.start with the task's expected_version.

Expected:

- The task transitions to ready and exactly one Run is created for it in the same transaction.
- task.create and task.assign remain unchanged: create still yields draft, assign still only changes worker/version.
- A task with an unresolved required dependency is refused rather than readied.

### P00.output_slot_binding_and_verification_request — P00

Setup: A task's acceptance contract names one required output slot (name, classification, media_type, max_bytes, artifact_digest check).

Action: Report the attempt with a published artifact bound to that slot, then inspect the sealed VerificationRequest and attempt a byte change after binding.

Expected:

- VerificationRequest.Outputs contains the bound slot with its resolved artifact, not an empty array.
- The bound digest cannot be changed after binding; a differing report is refused.
- A report omitting the required slot never reaches succeeded.

### P00.old_persisted_rows_remain_inspectable — P00

Setup: An Operation, Job, Status and Conversation row persisted before this revision lack attempts, callback_route, operation_id, runtime_ready and caller_unread_count/caller_last_read_marker respectively.

Action: Read each row back through its existing public/internal query operation after the revision-3 schema lands.

Expected:

- Every row validates against its updated schema with the new fields simply absent.
- No read fails, migrates destructively or fabricates a value for an absent optional field.
- Writing any of the rows again populates the new fields going forward without altering the unrelated persisted history.

## Delivery

Implement production behavior and meaningful local tests within scope. Report files changed, commands actually run, observed results, unresolved dependency qualifications and contract defects. A missing dependency may use an exact local fake for development; production must return a named prerequisite/unsupported error instead of fake success. Integration owns shared dependency changes, real assembly, cross-package proving and landing. Do not advertise release or client/platform support from compilation alone.
