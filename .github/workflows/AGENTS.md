# Implementation assignment: `.github/workflows`

Generated specification revision 5; source digest `bbc91db3ac44acaddc06c83714ebafddf1ad31f3f7a9d7522c3c1b0e69197c54`. This file is committed implementation context. Do not independently edit it. Everything required from the product specification and adjacent interfaces is embedded below; no RFC copy is required.

## Mission and scope

Own CI workflow validation and release qualification orchestration.

Write scope: **`.github/workflows/` only**, excluding this generated AGENTS.md. Go package name: `not a Go package`. Ownership kind: support; integration wave: 4.

Allowed production imports from this repository: standard library only; no product package imports. Tests may use interfaces/fakes defined locally and, once available, storage-backed temporary fixtures; integration owns cross-package tests. No sibling raw SQL. No root dependency edits except the integration exception stated in its own brief.

## Implementation decisions and acceptance focus

Build pinned Go toolchain and dependency lock on native Intel and Apple Silicon macOS for the first release, run spec renderer --check first, unit/integration/race tests appropriate to supported package/platform capabilities, controlled provider/subprocess parity and artifact retention. Separate native arm64 and amd64 macOS Flutter jobs install the pinned Flutter SDK (version bound to apps/desktop pubspec.lock and the dependency lock report), run flutter pub get with the lock enforced, dart format --set-exit-if-changed, flutter analyze, flutter test, the operation-catalog digest drift check and a release-mode flutter build for each Mac architecture; later Linux runner prerequisites (GTK development packages, Secret Service library, a virtual display for integration_test) are explicit workflow steps. The Flutter job never needs the Go toolchain cache and the Go jobs never need Flutter; cache keys bind pubspec.lock and the Flutter version. Required release jobs cannot silently skip mandatory platform/GUI/provider qualifications. Dependency/cache keys bind lock and toolchain. Never publish automatically from unreviewed branch or infer release permission from this prompt. Use read-only defaults, no secrets in PR logs/artifacts. Preserve Apache notices and build provenance. Linux is not advertised until its later qualification; Windows/remote MCP/contained runner are not first-Mac-release targets.

Local proving focus: Workflow syntax, clean checkout generation drift check, failed/omitted required gate blocks release, bounded logs and evidence artifacts.

## Incoming and outgoing boundaries

Incoming callers: entrypoint/assembly or tests via the explicit Go API.

Outgoing owner calls: none; use only declared Go dependency interfaces. Each exact input/output schema appears below. Calls retain current Unit/authority; owner allowlists are mandatory.

## Shared foundation contract

# Frozen implementation contract, revision 5

These decisions complete the product specification and bind every scope. Report contradictions with an affected-dependency list and proposed coordinated revision; do not change another owner's interface locally.

Revision 5 adds `SecretStore.Lookup(ctx, key) (opaqueRef, error)` for trusted code that must recover the current reference for a stable, locally owned secret name. `Put` still returns an opaque reference, and `Get`/`Delete` still accept only such references. Lookup validates the same key bounds as Put, returns `not_found` for a missing key, fails closed when the store is unavailable, and never returns secret bytes or creates a credential. Its result is installation-local and must never appear in a public operation payload, receipt, log, or model context. The helper receipt signer stores its key under `connections/helper/receipt-key`; connection completion resolves that exact name through Lookup and then Get. It must never trust a reference supplied by the receipt or caller. This additive Go interface revision affects `internal/contract`, `internal/platform`, `internal/connections`, `cmd/zatiti`, and their SecretStore test doubles; it changes no wire schema or persisted row.

Revision 4 stages the first distribution on macOS for both native arm64 and amd64. Linux remains the next supported target after its own qualification; Windows and mobile remain later. A Mac release cannot claim Intel or Apple Silicon support from compilation alone: each requires an installed, signed, notarized artifact and clean-host qualification. The product and operation contracts of revision 3 remain in force; this revision changes release dispatch order and platform evidence, not the wire schemas or persisted rows. Required provider, Serenity, backup/restore and other first-release guarantees are not waived by phasing Linux later. Setup must let an installed Mac app reach the pinned personal-chief conversation without environment variables, manual socket paths or manual controller startup; any new helper/discovery or secret-custody interface requires its own coordinated contract before dependent implementation.

Revision 3 changes, each a coordinated revision that code written against revision 2 must follow. Every new field named below is additive and optional on an existing type: no existing required field changed type, name or was removed, so old persisted rows validate unchanged and remain inspectable with the new field simply absent. New tables (`WorkerTurn`, proposal records) and new operations have no prior callers to break.

- **Durable worker turn.** Execution owns a persisted `WorkerTurn` (see the embedded `WorkerTurn`/`TurnSource` schemas in `internal/execution`'s generated prompt) keyed by unique `(installation_id, source_kind, source_id, source_version, recipient_worker_id)`; re-admission through `_execution.turn.admit` returns the same turn. A pending inbox message and its turn admission/processed marker (`_messaging.processed`) commit in one shared transaction. A message arriving during an active turn is admitted as a safe-boundary injection durably linked to that turn, never silently dropped or processed twice. One active decision stream exists per worker/task lane; different eligible workers may run concurrently within aggregate limits. Each model step/proposal is stored separately as a `ProposalRecord` keyed by unique `(turn_id, step_index, proposal_id)`; the same key with different bytes is `submission_conflict`.
- **Worker turn pipeline operations.** `_execution.work.pending`/`.claim`, `_execution.context.prepare`/`.commit`, `_execution.proposal.prepare`/`.record`, `_execution.report`, `_execution.verification.pending`/`.claim`, `_tasks.evidence.record`, `_tasks.dependencies.wake`, `_messaging.ready`/`.processed` are new internal operations driving the durable worker loop end to end (admit → claim work → prepare/commit context → dispatch a model or tool effect → record the proposal → report → independently verify). Public `task.start` transitions an eligible draft/ready task to ready and enqueues its run in the same transaction; `task.create`/`task.assign` are unchanged. Exact schemas, callers and behavior are embedded in the generated prompts of `internal/execution`, `internal/tasks` and `internal/messaging`.
- **Worker operation executor.** A narrow `contract.WorkerOperator` capability (declared below) lets a worker-authored local proposal invoke an ordinary public operation under the worker's own authenticated actor, scope-intersected with the task/source authorization envelope. It resolves the actor from the persisted turn/worker mapping; `WorkerID` is an asserted match against that turn, never a way to select any principal. Local model-visible operations are an explicit allowlist (authorized configuration authoring/inspection, task/delegation/responsibility actions, approved memory/messaging operations, output publication); grant/policy changes, secrets, internal bookkeeping and human review never become available merely because they exist in the public catalog. The controller's administrative identity authorizes scheduling/bookkeeping only, never a model proposal. **Public/internal caller fix:** `task.assign` is a public operation and carries no caller allowlist (the registry rejects a public descriptor with callers — confirmed 2026-09-18 descriptor-drift finding in docs/roadmap.md); a chief-driven assignment is an ordinary authenticated `task.assign` call made through this executor under the requesting worker's own actor, not a domain-internal caller path.
- **Effects callback routing.** `Operation` gains optional `attempts` (`{attempt_id, generation}` pairs, additive alongside the unchanged `attempt_ids`) and optional `callback_route`; `Dispatch` gains the matching optional `callback_route`. `_effects.prepare` accepts an optional `callback_route` (`CallbackRoute`: `worker_turn`/`job`/`memory`/`skill`/`connection` plus the relevant turn/step/job id) persisted alongside the action and returned at claim. The controller resolves callback routing from this persisted route; it never infers routing by inserting an undeclared `attempt_id` into strict adapter parameters (fixes audit finding G05). `_effects.record` gains an optional `current_generation` for the successor-generation rule: a stray attempt is `not_sent` if never actually claimed under its recorded generation, `outcome_unknown` if claimed but unconfirmed — never silently dropped.
- **Effects reconciliation reaches `Adapter.Reconcile`.** New `_effects.reconciliation.prepare`/`.record` create a separately admitted, separately authorized and accounted bounded reconciliation read distinct from the original write, merging the qualified observation into the original operation's uncertainty without overwriting history or replaying the original action (fixes audit finding G13).
- **Job registry linkage.** `_execution.job.create` gains an optional `operation_id`, linking a network-backed job to its originating effects `Operation` at creation so reconciliation resolves it without scanning another owner's table; a job without `operation_id` is an ordinary local runner. New `_skills.evaluation.record` and `_configuration.export.prepare`/`.record` route skill evaluation and configuration export/import through this durable job ledger instead of handler-local ID minting with no owner-backed lookup (fixes audit findings G11, G12).
- **Registry lookup and schema normalization (already implemented; confirmed for revision 3).** `Lookup(id, 0)` resolves the highest registered version for that operation id. The registry accepts either a bare `$defs`-relative schema or a fully self-contained document at registration, and `Lookup` always returns a self-contained document pruned to reachable `$defs`. These two rules were implemented and tested against application's assumptions before this revision; this entry is their authored record (docs/roadmap.md, 2026-09-18).
- **CLI root tokens (clarification, no schema change).** `Descriptor.CLI` is the subcommand path only and excludes the binary name; `cmd/zatiti` prepends `zatiti` once at command-tree assembly. Generated `AGENTS.md` prose shows the full invocation (for example "CLI `zatiti artifact export`") for readability — that rendering convenience is not part of the wire contract, and an implementer must not treat the printed binary name as part of `Descriptor.CLI` (this ambiguity produced a wrong descriptor token shape in 11 modules; docs/roadmap.md, 2026-09-18).
- **Service-principal bootstrap.** `_identity.bootstrap` gains optional `service_credential_id`/`service_store_ref` so the bootstrap-created controller service principal can receive a credential in the same transaction, letting an out-of-process controller authenticate; omitted fields leave the service principal credential-less for the in-process explicit-`Actor` seam, unchanged from revision 2.
- **Review eligibility (ruling, confirmed for revision 3).** The eligible reviewer of an exact review-class request is the human principal whose current authority admitted that request; services, workers and agents are never eligible, and proposer separation stays mandatory for them. This settles "an eligible owner's decision" left undefined in revision 2's policy/reviews briefs (docs/roadmap.md, 2026-09-18 evening REVISION-3 RULING).
- **Internal authority checks (ruling, confirmed for revision 3).** `_identity.authority`, like every internal operation, is gated by its caller allowlist and by the calling actor being a registered, unrevoked principal in the transaction's installation — never by requiring the calling actor to independently hold the capability named in its own request. A standing grant of `_identity.authority` to work around a circular subject-capability check is unnecessary and must not be relied upon (docs/roadmap.md, 2026-09-19 REVISION-3 RULING). Whether an actor may read another principal's authority is an explicit code-level decision this ruling does not settle; downstream implementers must document it in place rather than infer it.
- **Artifact locator staging (confirmed unchanged).** `PhysicalCallEvidence.request_context` and `ModelOutput.request_context` remain the revision-2 `ArtifactLocator` retype; revision 3 makes no further change here and extends the same staged/artifact pattern to `_execution.context.commit`'s `staged_context`.
- **Responses `prepare_session`/`model_step` split.** See "OpenAI Responses session preparation" below.
- **Small query/result additions.** `conversation.get`/`.list` return the calling principal's optional `caller_unread_count`/`caller_last_read_marker`; new public `conversation.message.list` reads authorized message history for one conversation. New public `memory.list` lists authorized scoped claim refs (source/freshness/lineage/supported actions) without performing paid retrieval. `Artifact` gains optional `source_operation_id`/`purpose` (provenance). `Status` gains optional `runtime_ready`. `Responsibility` gains optional `last_cycle_id`, and `_scheduling.cycle.record` gains a required `cycle_id` replay/conflict fence plus optional `turn_id` linkage. New public `installation.verifier.list` enumerates installed trusted verifier profiles (secret-free) so a task's acceptance contract can name one. `event.list`'s drained-cursor/filter/scope/principal/retention behavior is unchanged; this is its explicit revision-3 confirmation, not a schema change. Public task/turn status projection and installed-capability desktop surfacing are explicitly deferred to `internal/evidence` (P34) and `apps/desktop` (P42) rather than invented here.
- **Local decision tools pinned separately from provider tools.** `ReplyProposal`, `ClarifyProposal`, `ReportOutputsProposal` and `CycleDecisionProposal` (schemas below) are the sealed names/inputs for the context builder's non-provider decision tools (`reply`, `clarify`, `report_outputs`, `cycle_decision`). They are execution-local proposals evaluated by the worker operation executor, never routed through a `connections.Tool`/adapter and never given a provider operation mapping; a final text answer alone may complete a chat turn but never implicitly fulfills a task's required outputs.
- Desktop client (ADR 002): the desktop is a Flutter application at `apps/desktop` that is a direct wire client of internal/server. The Go roots `internal/desktop` and `cmd/zatiti-desktop` are retired; no Go package may import or stand in for the desktop.
- Adapter request context: `PhysicalCallEvidence.request_context` and `ModelOutput.request_context` are an `ArtifactLocator`, not a bare `ArtifactRef`. Adapters return the staged variant; the controller publishes it and substitutes the artifact variant in normalized evidence.
- Installation database seam: `contract.DatabaseBackup` is a one-method capability that entrypoint assembly supplies only to internal/installation through `installation.WithDatabaseBackup`. `contract.Dependencies` is unchanged and no domain gains general database access.

## Build and dependency decisions

Module `github.com/zatiti/zatiti`; language `go 1.26.0`; initial toolchain `go1.26.2`. Integration owns go.mod/go.sum. The Flutter desktop pins its own Flutter/Dart SDK and plugins in `apps/desktop/pubspec.lock`; integration records those pins and licenses in the same lock report and the Go module never depends on them. Domains import standard library and internal/contract, not sibling domains. Application composes owner methods through a checked in-process dispatcher: ordinary Go calls, not another server or scheduler.

Library families: Cobra CLI; official MCP Go SDK, handwritten adapter for MCP `2025-11-25`; Flutter (Dart) desktop application at `apps/desktop` with an operating-system secure-storage plugin, outside the Go module; modernc.org/sqlite. Mint is optional build-time tooling and cannot weaken contracts. Hosted provider v1: a specifically qualified OpenAI Responses endpoint/profile, with configured model and prices. Other compatible endpoints remain unavailable until qualified. GitHub uses documented REST over net/http, with mutation retries disabled. Serenity is a separate pinned service using public interfaces only. Integration must resolve exact dependency releases/commits, checksums, licenses and qualification commands in a lock report BEFORE dispatching dependent implementation. These are selected implementation families, not claims that upstream behavior has been qualified. No agent independently substitutes libraries, models, prices, accounts or Serenity APIs. Dependency resolution/qualification is an explicit foundation assignment.

## Shared Go declarations

The contract owner implements these exact declarations. Omitted function bodies are the implementation assignment, not production stubs. Public JSON uses snake_case. Schema-derived DTO names concatenate operation path segments in PascalCase plus Input/Output and live in the owning package. JSON integer => int64, UUID => contract.ID, timestamp => time.Time, optional scalar => pointer, array => slice, explicitly open JSON => json.RawMessage. Unknown fields are rejected.

The registry binds concrete input/output DTO types to descriptors and handlers using `Bind[I, O any](descriptor contract.Descriptor, fn func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. JSON decoding is strict and schema validation precedes execution. Internal cross-owner calls use the same schema-checked Invocation boundary to avoid sibling package imports. They retain the same Unit, actor, scope, generation and transaction; cannot mint authority; and are not exposed as public operations.

## Transaction and ownership rules

Each domain owns tables prefixed with its package name and `_`. Schema and migration bodies inside that namespace are package-private; no other package depends on their layout. Storage owns installation generation, migration metadata and `storage_events`. Evidence owns commands/receipts. Migration ordering is explicit in application assembly. All migrations run under exclusive installation ownership before serving. Cross-owner reads and changes use Ports.Call and the embedded internal schemas. Internal operations have a caller allowlist. The dispatcher detects recursive calls. Queries cannot invoke mutation descriptors. Public clients cannot supply Actor or Unit or invoke internal operations.

One controller, one ordered writer, WAL, foreign keys on every connection, synchronous FULL, busy timeout 5 seconds, consistent read snapshots. Database.Write performs ONE transaction callback attempt with no automatic callback retry. Busy exhaustion returns controller_unavailable/retryable. Unit is valid only inside its callback; no goroutines or retained handles. Unit.Emit appends state-correlated evidence to the storage outbox in the same transaction. Delivery is at least once and consumers deduplicate event IDs. No network/model calls, secret-store access, filesystem streaming or subprocess work inside a Unit. Stage bytes or local helper actions outside transactions, then publish metadata or reconciliation intent through owner methods.

Handler errors roll back the entire transaction. Persist a command refusal in a separate short transaction after rollback where necessary, retaining the original request identity. Query command IDs need not be durable. All mutations return durable command IDs; accepted responses must identify inspectable durable work. Output schemas describe Payload.Data, not the result envelope. Never leak SQL, tokens, provider raw responses or private paths through Fault.

Definition creates/updates/archive stage drafts, including schedules, responsibilities, policies and memory bindings. Only configuration.apply activates definitions. It validates owners' candidate slices, seals base revision/dependencies/requirements, and calls internal activate in the same transaction under old authority. Internal activate is admitted only from the compiler during exact plan application, not by a public flag. Public restrictive pause/revoke/cancel commits immediately without compilation or spending. Archive staging may immediately disable new admissions as an explicitly reported restrictive side effect; final removal waits for obligations.

## Effect and execution rules

Admit: current authorization, exact review/preconditions, all budget reservations, attempt/dispatch intent and evidence atomically. Claim: second transaction rechecks generation/restrictions/expiry and consumes the one-use claim. Invoke the adapter outside transactions. Record: third transaction stores observations, costs or retained uncertainty and events. Each physical call, including reconciliation and retries, has a distinct attempt. Reconciliation is an admitted bounded read and links to the original effect; it does not overwrite history. Internal jobs use explicitly provisioned scoped service identities plus current worker/task restrictions.

Once claimed, crash/timeout/cancel/lease expiry/operator acknowledgement/weak not-found cannot prove nonexecution. Preserve outcome_unknown and its reservation until authoritative evidence. Earlier unknown attempts survive later failures. Mutation SDK/HTTP retries are disabled. Even qualified idempotent retries need fresh authorization and physical-attempt evidence. Trusted adapters resolve credential references outside transactions; no public raw secrets or inherited owner credential environment. Fencing external workers blocks Zatiti mutations but cannot prove their processes stopped.

Task success needs independently established acceptance against pinned verifier code/version, sealed inputs and observations. Worker report/exit zero cannot set succeeded. Defaults: one concurrent attempt/worker, four/installation, 30 minutes/attempt, 100 model steps, eight children, delegation depth three, root deadline 24 hours. Configure explicit currency and finite spend limits before paid work. Amounts are int64 micro-units with checked overflow; rational rates use integer numerator/denominator and round reservations upward. Unknown/advisory usage and missing prices are not zero. Children share root and ancestor budgets.

## Wire conventions and limits

UUIDv4 for new identities; stable UUID references thereafter. SHA-256 lowercase hex digests. Versioned canonical JSON sorts keys, rejects duplicate keys/unknown fields, preserves exact integer values and semantic array order; schema-declared sets sort by stable identity. Preserve exact skill bytes. UTC RFC3339Nano timestamps and int64 versions >=1. Patches and snapshots are distinct; explicit delete only. Inert `extensions` alone permits namespaced extra keys. Scope is explicit and every referenced object is revalidated; no implicit global organization.

Default limits: JSON request 1 MiB; chunk 1 MiB decoded; artifact 256 MiB; skill archive 16 MiB compressed, 64 MiB expanded, 4096 entries, depth 32; list 50/max 200; read 1 MiB; redacted log record 8 KiB; event page 100/max 500; upload expiry 24 hours. Narrowing is allowed, increases require authorized configuration. Reject overflow and unsupported bounds.

Mutations require submission_key (1..128 printable ASCII) except one-time init. Bind principal, operation/version and canonical input hash. Retain >=30 days and through unresolved obligations. Replay identical input returns original disposition BEFORE stale-version validation; changed input => submission_conflict. Concurrent duplicates serialize. Recover lost acknowledgements by command lookup, not a new key. Resource updates require expected_version; apply requires base_revision and plan digest. Creation has no existing version. Opaque authenticated cursors bind principal/scope/filter/order/snapshot and expire explicitly with cursor_expired and snapshot_required=true. Event replay cannot silently omit a gap.

HTTP POST `/v1/operations/{operation_id}` uses the common request envelope. Local HTTP runs over a private Unix socket. The Flutter desktop is a direct client of this endpoint: the private Unix socket locally and, for an explicitly configured remote desktop, mutual TLS mapped to current application principals over the same operation contract, never remote MCP. It shares the envelope, fault mapping, limits, submission-key replay and cursor rules with every other client, holds no business logic or database access, and consumes the generated operation catalog rather than any Go package. Completed => HTTP 200; accepted => 202. Failed mapping: invalid_input 400, permission_denied 403, not_found 404, stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict/review_required/outcome_unknown/artifact_fault 409, cursor_expired 410, prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported/verification_failed 422, controller_unavailable 503, internal_error 500. Domain failures always include the result envelope.

CLI completed/accepted => exit 0; invalid_input 2; permission_denied/review_required 3; stale_version/submission_conflict/conflict 4; prerequisite_missing/external_action_required/budget_unavailable/capability_unsupported 5; controller_unavailable/outcome_unknown 6; other failures 1. CLI --json emits one envelope to stdout, diagnostics stderr, no implicit prompts. MCP structuredContent is the full envelope, text is equivalent JSON, failed => isError true, malformed protocol => protocol error. Dot-separated operation IDs map to CLI tokens and `zatiti_` MCP names. Exceptions: installation.init => `zatiti init` / `zatiti_installation_init`; capabilities.list => `zatiti capabilities` / `zatiti_capabilities`. Lifecycle steps are individual tools. Tool input never selects a credential profile or accepts raw secrets/unrestricted server paths.

## Completion policy

Write only within the assigned root. Do not edit this prompt, siblings, shared contracts, root dependencies or external acceptance inputs. Implement exact fake dependencies locally; do not return invented production success for unavailable prerequisites. Use controlled providers, deterministic clocks and synthetic fixtures. Preserve expected/observed results and failure evidence. Package tests prove local properties; actual subprocess parity, crash recovery, desktop and adapter qualification prove integration. Z01-Z21 and first-release journeys must pass on both Intel and Apple Silicon macOS before the Mac release is claimed; Linux requires its own later qualification before Linux support is advertised.

## Local IO, authentication, jobs and verification seams

These additional declarations are part of the SAME frozen contract package (using imports already shown). Implementing an interface does not permit calling it inside a Unit except where the signature explicitly takes Unit/Reader.

```go
type Authenticator interface {
    Authenticate(context.Context, Reader, []byte) (Actor, error)
    AuthenticateCertificate(context.Context, Reader, Digest) (Actor, error)
}

    Owner string
    Invocation Invocation
    Actor Actor
    Scope Scope

}

### Restore protocol (revision 3)

The six-step offline restore protocol (contract-proposals.md section 7) is split across two owners as shipped, not implemented by a single entrypoint-owned capability supplied to `internal/installation` alone: `internal/installation`'s public `installation.restore` operation performs steps 1-3 without ever touching the live database file, and `internal/controller` performs steps 4-6. `installation.restore` runs the same synchronous LocalIO Prepare/Perform/Finish flow as `installation.backup` (`internal/installation/restore.go`): Prepare requires exclusive maintenance, validates the pinned backup artifact and creates the durable job; Perform (outside any transaction) decrypts and verifies the uploaded bundle's binding, integrity and framed image, then — before any rewind — exports a sealed, published `RecoveryOverlay` document of this installation's CURRENT pre-restore state (source database digest from the `DatabaseBackup` capability, plus the obligations `snapshotObligations` captured at Prepare time from pending effects and unresolved memory writes); Finish registers that overlay artifact and leaves the job `running` with an `external_action_required` requirement naming the verified backup image. `internal/installation` never swaps the SQLite file itself: a domain module cannot replace the live database out from under its own open handle mid-process, so the installation stays merely paused, not yet rewound, once `installation.restore` completes.

That handoff is driven forward by `RestoreLifecycle`, declared in `internal/controller` (`internal/controller/restore.go`) — not `contract.SnapshotInventory`/`contract.RestoreCoordinator` as this section previously described; no such contract-package types exist. `RestoreLifecycle` has two methods: `StageCandidate(ctx context.Context, restoreJobID contract.ID, dir string) (RestoreCandidate, error)` resolves the job's already-verified backup artifact into a locally staged, decrypted candidate database file, and `MergeOverlay(ctx context.Context, u contract.Unit, restoreJobID contract.ID) error` folds the already-captured `RecoveryOverlay` into every owner's own tables monotonically — never resurrecting a revoked credential, resending a consumed dispatch or erasing a liability absent from the older snapshot — inside one transaction. It is a field of `controller.Collaborators` (`RestoreLifecycle RestoreLifecycle`), attached through `Controller.Attach` exactly like `Verifier`/`Operator`/`Blobs`: only entrypoint assembly may supply an implementation, because only it has direct Go access to `internal/installation`'s private bundle/key/overlay code, and the controller itself never decrypts a backup bundle or resolves a secret reference. `cmd/zatiti/restore.go` defines the one production implementation (unexported `restoreLifecycle{}`); `cmd/zatiti/serve.go`'s `superviseController` wires it into `Collaborators.RestoreLifecycle` alongside every other trusted collaborator before `ctl.Attach(collab)`.

Once a job reaches `running`/`external_action_required`, the controller's own tick flow claims it and `runRestore` drives the remaining steps: quiesce admission and drain every other in-flight unit (`drainOrdinary`), stage the candidate image via `RestoreLifecycle.StageCandidate` and hand it to `storage.Restorable.PrepareRestore`/`CommitRestore` for the atomic file-level swap and generation advance (`performSwap`), fold the overlay via `RestoreLifecycle.MergeOverlay` inside the transaction `storage.Restorable.WriteRestoreOverlay` opens on the freshly reopened, still-paused database, then call `storage.Restorable.ResumeAfterRestore` to lift the write gate (`mergeAndResume`), and finally report the durable disposition back to `internal/installation` through its own internal `_installation.restore.record` operation (`failRestore`/`settleRestore`). A controller lifetime that itself performs the swap cannot continue afterward: its `*application.Application` was built over the now-closed pre-restore database handle and there is no seam to repoint it, so `Controller.Run` returns the `ErrRestoreHandoff` sentinel error — not a fault — the instant the swap, overlay merge and storage resume are durable. `cmd/zatiti`'s `runServe` is an outer loop around exactly this signal: on `ErrRestoreHandoff` it calls `reassembleAfterRestoreHandoff` (closes the stale `Application` and database, reopens storage at the same path — which already observes the swap — and calls `Database.StartGeneration` again to fence out the lifetime that just ended) under the SAME held installation lock, then runs again. A crash mid-protocol recovers the same way at the next startup: `recoverRestoreBeforeFence` runs before the ordinary generation fence and drives any journal entry left open forward from its last durable phase, re-checking `storage.Restorable.RestorePaused` rather than trusting the last written phase, so it never repeats an already-committed swap or loses track of one.

Current state, honestly: production's only `RestoreLifecycle` implementation, `cmd/zatiti`'s `restoreLifecycle{}`, fails both methods closed with `contract.CodePrerequisiteMissing` rather than guessing or fabricating success — exactly the fallback `Collaborators.RestoreLifecycle`'s own doc comment designs for. `StageCandidate` fails because no operation, public or internal, exposes a pending restore job's original backup-artifact reference to entrypoint assembly (public `job.get`'s wire projection never carries `Input`; only the controller's own internal `_execution.job.claim` call does, and that result stays in the controller's private journal entry). `MergeOverlay` fails because no owner-defined merge operation yet exists in `internal/effects`, `internal/identity` or `internal/memory` to fold a `RecoveryOverlay`'s obligations into their own tables, and because credential/grant revocation obligations are never captured into the overlay to begin with: `snapshotObligations` (`internal/installation/restore.go`) records only `claimed_effect`/`unknown_effect` and `memory_write` obligation kinds. This is a scoped, tracked gap — new merge operations spanning effects/identity/memory, revocation-obligation capture in `snapshotObligations`, a job-input lookup path for `StageCandidate` — not a defect in what shipped: a restore observed without a working merge/staging path is recorded failed with `prerequisite_missing`, and the database is never touched by an incomplete attempt. A clean destination additionally needs a secure key-transfer/provisioning route; an opaque source secret-store reference alone is not portability. Missing required Serenity export guarantees blocks a full-memory backup claim; an empty `Brains` array must never be reported complete.

Identity Service also implements Authenticator. Application receives this interface explicitly in New; it uses a dedicated read snapshot and never reads identity-owned tables itself. Only the byte-slice credential boundary carries secret authentication material, never Invocation JSON. Zero sensitive buffers after use where practical; no logging. Certificate authentication resolves a preprovisioned credential reference and follows the same current principal/revocation rules.

Artifacts, skills, connections and installation Services also implement LocalIO. The registry detects this interface at assembly and routes ONLY registered local IO operations through Prepare/Perform/Finish: artifact.upload.chunk/finish/cancel/read/export; skill.import; connection.setup.begin/complete/cancel; installation.init/backup/restore. LocalIO handles local bounded files, secure helpers and backup work, never unadmitted provider/model calls. Prepare strictly validates input, versions, identity and authority and records replayable local intent under IOPlan.ID; Perform receives that exact trusted in-memory plan outside transactions, resolves opaque staging/helper references, and returns metadata; Finish rechecks authority/versions/generation and commits result/evidence. IOPlan is never public, accepted from an agent or stored with secrets. Prepared/Data JSON must use the operation's declared schemas plus private owner-local metadata, which no other package reads. No cross-owner business protocol may hide in those private fields. Perform must support safe replay of local staging/publication by plan ID, or preserve an inspectable failed/unknown local obligation. A synchronous read does not return bytes to client until final authorization check. New raw provider writes always use effects, not this interface.

For synchronous local IO mutations, persist command identity plus accepted internal pending disposition at Prepare, then replace pending disposition once at Finish. Concurrent same-key calls join/inspect that same in-progress command and never run duplicate Perform. The controller can recover abandoned local intents using the execution job API. Async backup/export uses the same interface with an inspectable job returned immediately. The artifact.upload.chunk endpoint has a 2 MiB encoded request cap (all other ordinary JSON requests 1 MiB), allowing the specified 1 MiB decoded chunk plus envelope.

Execution owns shared durable jobs (execution_jobs), distinct from runs and physical effects. `_execution.job.create` stores the original owner/operation/input and idempotent source identity; public job.get inspects any authorized job. Controller lists pending jobs, claims generation-bound ownership, invokes the named LocalIO owner outside transactions through its exact plan, and records result/obligation. Network jobs first prepare effects and wait on their recorded outcomes. `_execution.job.record` stores result data matching the originating operation's explicit completion_schema and links actual artifact/operation evidence. Never mark a job succeeded merely because its physical request was accepted.

Tasks calls `_execution.enqueue` with ready pinned task inside the same transaction; execution creates one run for task/version and returns it. `_tasks.ready` also exposes a bounded recovery scan. Execution's verifier constructor is `NewVerifier(contract.VerifierDependencies) (contract.Verifier,error)`. Verify executes outside Unit and returns actual independently established observations under the pinned accepted profile; `_execution.verification.record` rechecks attempt/task/version before changing task state. A forged worker-provided VerificationResult is never accepted through public report. Concrete context/adapter/verification payload schemas are included in relevant prompts.

Administrative effects that have no task use their command/operation ID as an accountable admission root; no fictional worker/task or fabricated task foreign key is required. Accounting skips absent scope dimensions but always reserves installation and present organization ancestors/project limits. Task effects additionally share root_task_id. A profile without enforceable charge bounds cannot claim a hard cap.

Typed handler bindings return `contract.Outcome[O]` so accepted results and page cursors survive typed registration. The frozen Bind signature is `Bind[I, O any](contract.Descriptor, func(context.Context, contract.Unit, I) (contract.Outcome[O], error)) (contract.Handler, error)`. Errors carry Fault and roll back, while accepted/completed status and cursor come from Outcome.

Assembly order: application.NewPorts() returns an unbound *PortRouter; For(owner string) returns an owner-bound contract.Ports without domain calls; construct identity and all other modules with those ports, passing installation.WithDatabaseBackup(backup-only wrapper over the opened Database) to installation.New and to no other constructor; registry.New(modules); application.New(db, registry, identityAuthenticator, clock, ids); router.Bind(app) exactly once; start serving only after Bind. PortRouter exposes `For(string) contract.Ports` and `Bind(*Application) error`, rejects pre-bind invocation, and never allows a domain to change its bound caller identity. Registry also implements Module for its own capabilities methods. Constructor execution must not query peers or start goroutines.

All native BlobStore objects are encrypted at rest (including public-classification content), because Stage has no classification argument. Metadata publication sets encrypted=true; classification separately governs disclosure. Controller records the raw adapter observation and cost disposition durably first, then publishes StagedOutput bytes outside Unit, then commits artifact metadata and normalized owner callbacks through an outbox consumer. Publication failure is a visible artifact obligation and blocks task/job acceptance; it does not erase a confirmed provider observation or authorize resending. The adapter cannot mint artifact IDs: AdapterDependencies carries no IDSource and BlobStore.Stage returns only a staging reference, digest and size. The same handoff covers the request record. Each adapter stages its exact secret-free request before sending and names it in `physical_call.request_context` as a staged ArtifactLocator with a matching StagedOutput of purpose context; the controller publishes it with the other staged bytes, for every disposition including not_sent and unknown, and delivers normalized evidence whose request_context is the artifact variant. The raw recorded observation keeps the staged locator and is never rewritten.

Installation alone needs the bytes of a consistent SQLite backup: BackupManifest requires database_digest/database_size and RecoveryOverlay requires source_database_digest, while Dependencies {Clock, IDs, Ports, Secrets, Blobs} deliberately exposes no database. The seam is the DatabaseBackup capability above and these exact declarations in internal/installation: `type Option func(*Service)`; `func WithDatabaseBackup(contract.DatabaseBackup) Option`; `func New(contract.Dependencies, ...Option) (*Service, error)`. `New(deps)` without options stays valid, so the common domain constructor shape holds. Dependencies gains no field and no other module receives the capability. Entrypoint assembly passes a wrapper value whose method set is exactly Backup and which delegates to the opened contract.Database, never the Database value itself; installation must not type-assert the capability to any wider interface or retain it beyond the Service. Installation calls Backup only from LocalIO.Perform for installation.backup and for the pre-restore recovery overlay, never inside a Unit, streaming through a hashing writer into BlobStore.Stage so database_digest/database_size and source_database_digest describe the exact staged bytes without unbounded buffering or a caller-supplied path. The capability grants no query, write, migration, event-feed or file-path access and is not the restore rewind mechanism. When the option is absent, installation.backup and installation.restore fail prerequisite_missing naming the database backup capability; they never fabricate a digest, and every other installation operation is unaffected.

Entrypoint assembly owns platform.Acquire -> storage.Open -> Migrate -> Database.StartGeneration, exactly once before controller/server admission. Pass the held contract.Ownership into controller.New; controller never acquires a second lock or advances generation again. Ownership.Lost closes when ownership is lost/released; stop admission immediately. Generation is a persisted local-controller fence, not distributed locking. The installation lock is retained until controller shutdown and DB close.

Remote TLS additionally validates the certificate chain and maps the SHA-256 certificate SPKI fingerprint through application.AuthenticateCertificate(ctx,Digest), which delegates to identity Authenticator.AuthenticateCertificate on a read snapshot. Only a verified TLS peer can enter that API; operation input cannot supply the fingerprint. Store certificate fingerprints as identity-owned authentication metadata on an explicitly provisioned credential reference. If a bearer credential is also supplied, its principal must match the verified certificate principal. No self-asserted certificate name, profile name or fingerprint header grants authority.

Every async operation declares completion_schema separately from its immediate Job response. job.get returns that schema as Job.result only when established; pending jobs omit result. Local IO mutations that may be recovered asynchronously accept either their completed resource output or `{job: Job}` in the descriptor output schema. Bootstrap remains synchronous under its exclusive one-time lock. No unspecified job kind may execute: _execution.job.create requires a registered completion_schema or a specifically registered private local-intent recovery contract.

Evidence retains the complete original result envelope for command replay, including fault message/details/retryability and cursor; projections of status/data/error_code must agree with Command.result. `_evidence.command.finish` takes that exact result. A replay cannot reconstruct a different error or lose an accepted job reference. ScopeRequired lists installation_id where input scope is required; resource-specific organization/project/worker conditions are enforced by the owned operation schemas and current referenced-resource validation, never inferred from a profile name.

Descriptor.Callers carries the exact catalog internal caller allowlist into runtime registration; application enforces this metadata rather than inventing it from operation names. Internal metadata remains available to trusted assembly/registry while public capability output contains public operations only. An empty allowlist never authorizes an internal call.

## OpenAI Responses session preparation (revision 3)

The checked-in `internal/adapters/responses` adapter created a provider conversation and then called Responses inside one `Invoke`, which is two physical requests behind a contract that specifies exactly one physical call per claimed effect (audit finding G27). Revision 3 freezes the split into two explicit effects, each making one physical call, with a persisted session handle passed between them:

- `prepare_session` — `kind: "prepare_session"` — creates the provider conversation and returns its authoritative handle as `ResponsesEvidence.session_handle` (a stable provider-issued string, never fabricated locally). **Disclosure:** the action carries no model-visible content beyond what an empty conversation creation requires; no `context_artifact` is sent. **Timeout:** a timeout after the request was sent leaves the session unknown, not absent — the caller must not create a second session on an unconfirmed `prepare_session` outcome; it waits for recovery. **Cost:** session creation itself is not billed by the pinned protocol; usage is `unknown`/advisory only if the provider's behavior deviates from that pin. **Unknown outcome:** if session creation may have succeeded but its response was lost, retain the unknown outcome without resending — a fresh `prepare_session` could create a second, unlinked provider conversation.
- `model_step` — `kind: "model_step"` — names the persisted session handle (`ResponsesParameters.session_handle`, required) and sends the model input (`context_artifact`, `max_output_tokens`, `tool_contract_versions`). **Disclosure:** exactly the pinned `context_artifact`; no other model-visible bytes. **Timeout:** a timeout after bytes were sent is `outcome_unknown`; an empty item list is equally consistent with "never ran" and "still running" (the provider documents no conversation search), so nonexecution is never assumed. **Cost:** reserved against the profile's accepted token bound before dispatch; a lookup that finds output but no usage cannot release the worst-case billing liability, so it stays reserved. **Unknown outcome:** preserved exactly as any other adapter unknown — no automatic fresh call, no silent retry.

`ResponsesParameters` is versioned to require `kind` (`prepare_session` | `model_step`) as a discriminator; `model_step` additionally requires `session_handle`. `session_handle` is scoped to the same conversation/context lineage as the turn that created it and is never reused across turns. P13 implements both translations against the pinned protocol; P15 consumes the resolved handle when preparing a `model_step` action; P12/P23 journal and dispatch each effect separately through the callback-routed `_effects.prepare`/`.record` pipeline above, so a lost `prepare_session` acknowledgement and a lost `model_step` acknowledgement are two independently recoverable unknowns, never conflated into one. Exact `ResponsesParameters`/`ResponsesEvidence` field-level schemas are frozen in `docs/implementation/adapter-schemas.json` and embedded in `internal/adapters/responses`'s generated prompt; this section is the coordinated-revision record for why they carry a `kind` discriminator and a `session_handle`, not a description of a new adapter behavior beyond the split itself.

## Local decision tool schemas (revision 3)

`ReplyProposal { text }`, `ClarifyProposal { question }`, `ReportOutputsProposal { bindings: [{name, artifact}] }` and `CycleDecisionProposal { decision: continue|wait|escalate|done, reason, next_wake? }` are frozen in `docs/implementation/operations.json`'s `$defs` (via `tools/specgen/model.py`) as `LocalDecisionTool`, a `oneOf` over the four. They are the sealed names/inputs contract-proposals.md section 4 requires before P16 interprets model output: execution-local proposals the context builder registers as non-provider tool definitions, never routed through a `connections.Tool`/adapter and never given a provider operation mapping. A final `reply` alone may complete a chat turn; it never implicitly fulfills a task's required outputs, which only `report_outputs` (bound through `_tasks.evidence.record`) can do.

## Owned product requirements

### R13-002 (source section 13; primary owner integration)

| Stage | Deliverable | Exit gate |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Go binary, SQLite/controller ownership, bootstrap, identity, operation registry, CLI and MCP adapters | One real operation round-trips through both; bootstrap and denial parity; clean restart |
| 2 | Hierarchical organizations/chiefs/projects/workers, skills, connections, compiler/revisions, first desktop conversation | Personal-chief setup, child creation, exact plans, secret-free provisioning, concurrent apply and portability |
| 3 | Tasks/responsibilities, hosted/cooperative execution, schedules and reasoning cycles, mailboxes, reviews, effects, accounting and Serenity bindings | Governed work and scoped recall survive failure; verified completion and physical-call fault tests |
| 4 | Earned autonomy, desktop daily workflows, chief memory curation, artifact/evidence/recovery/backup completion and qualified adapters | CLI/MCP and desktop journeys, Z01-Z21, restore, packaging and named client compatibility |

### R13-003 (source section 13; primary owner integration)

CLI and MCP ship together at every stage; MCP is not a later wrapper around a finished CLI. Desktop workflows use the same operations and authorization, while presenting only what the human needs for the task. Do not advertise the first release until the full first-release gates pass. Build implementation plans from the current frontier, using actual schemas and capability evidence. Additional remote transports, contained runners, channels and clients require separate RFC amendments and qualification.

### R14-002 (source section 14; primary owner distribution)

Distribute Zatiti under Apache License 2.0 and include the unmodified license in [LICENSE](LICENSE). Preserve applicable attribution and license notices for reused dependencies. No private source, proprietary integration, personal infrastructure or confidential operational history is required to understand, build, test or run the project.

### R14-003 (source section 14; primary owner distribution)

Examples and fixtures use synthetic identities, placeholder account bindings and controlled providers. Repository documentation contains no real credentials, private hostnames, personal filesystem paths, private repository references, customer records or unpublished operational details. Public provider and standards references are allowed where they specify an interoperable contract.

### R14-004 (source section 14; primary owner distribution)

Keep the README honest about implementation status. Publish installation commands only after they work from the documented release artifacts. Pin dependencies and supported protocol/profile versions when implementing; this draft does not assert that current upstream binaries or model accounts satisfy its requirements.
## Exact operation and dependency schemas

No operation handlers are owned or called by this scope. Its Go interfaces are specified above.

## Named acceptance cases

Tests are implementation deliverables, not claims of already executed qualification. Retain expected/observed results, exact source/config/tool versions and failure evidence.

Workflow syntax, clean checkout generation drift check, failed/omitted required gate blocks release, bounded logs and evidence artifacts.

## Delivery

Implement production behavior and meaningful local tests within scope. Report files changed, commands actually run, observed results, unresolved dependency qualifications and contract defects. A missing dependency may use an exact local fake for development; production must return a named prerequisite/unsupported error instead of fake success. Integration owns shared dependency changes, real assembly, cross-package proving and landing. Do not advertise release or client/platform support from compilation alone.
